### Training Approach

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
- Efficient fine-tuning with minimal memory
- Only 0.1-1% of parameters updated
- Prevents catastrophic forgetting
- Fast training and convergence

**Target Modules**
```python
target_modules = [
    "q_proj",      # Query projection
    "k_proj",      # Key projection
    "v_proj",      # Value projection
    "o_proj",      # Output projection
    "gate_proj",   # Gate projection (MLP)
    "up_proj",     # Up projection (MLP)
    "down_proj"    # Down projection (MLP)
]
```

**Hyperparameters**
- LoRA rank (r): 16 (tunable: 8-64)
- LoRA alpha: 32 (typically 2x rank)
- Learning rate: 2e-4
- Batch size: 2 (effective: 16 with gradient accumulation)
- Max sequence length: 2048 (supports up to 16K)

## FastFormula Domain Adaptation

### Custom Tokenization

Added domain-specific tokens for better FastFormula understanding:

**Control Flow**
```
DEFAULT FOR, IF, THEN, ELSIF, ELSE, RETURN
```

**Common Variables**
```
HOURS_WORKED, PAY_RATE, OVERTIME_PAY
BASE_SALARY, BONUS_AMOUNT, TAX_RATE
```

**Special Markers**
```
### START, ### END
FORMULA_BEGIN, FORMULA_END
```

### Prompt Format

**Training Format**
```
### Instruction:
{user_question}

### Response:
{formula_code}
```

**Why This Format?**
- Clear separation of instruction and response
- Matches code generation conventions
- Better than conversational format for code
- Compatible with many code models

## Training Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing
```
JSONL files → Parse → Format → Tokenize → Batches
```

### 2. Model Initialization
```
Load base model → Add custom tokens → Resize embeddings → Setup LoRA
```

### 3. Training Loop
```
Forward pass → Compute loss → Backward pass → Update weights
Every N steps: Evaluate → Save checkpoint
```

### 4. Model Saving
```
Save best model → Save tokenizer → Save config → Save LoRA weights
```

## Memory Optimization Techniques

### Gradient Checkpointing
- Trades computation for memory
- Reduces memory by ~40%
- Slightly slower training (~20%)

### Mixed Precision Training
- Uses bfloat16 instead of float32
- Reduces memory by ~50%
- Maintains numerical stability
- Requires modern GPU (Ampere+)

### Gradient Accumulation
- Simulates larger batch size
- Accumulate gradients over N steps
- Update once per N steps
- Memory usage: 1 batch, training quality: N batches

## Best Practices

### Training

1. **Start with LoRA**
   - Always use LoRA unless you have 24GB+ VRAM
   - Start with r=16, increase if underfitting

2. **Monitor Validation Loss**
   - Stop if validation loss stops decreasing
   - Typically 3-5 epochs is sufficient
   - More data = more epochs possible

3. **Learning Rate**
   - Start with 2e-4
   - Decrease if loss oscillates
   - Increase if learning too slowly

4. **Batch Size**
   - Use largest batch size that fits in memory
   - Compensate with gradient accumulation
   - Effective batch size 16-32 works well

### Inference

1. **Temperature Control**
   - 0.1-0.3: Deterministic, safe code
   - 0.5-0.7: Balanced creativity
   - 0.8-1.0: More creative, risky

2. **Top-p Sampling**
   - 0.9: Standard, good balance
   - 0.95: More variety
   - <0.85: More focused

3. **Repetition Penalty**
   - 1.0: No penalty
   - 1.1-1.3: Reduce repetition
   - >1.5: May hurt coherence

## Deployment Considerations

### Hardware Requirements

**Development/Testing**
- GPU: 12GB+ VRAM
- RAM: 32GB
- Storage: 50GB

**Production**
- GPU: 16GB+ VRAM (for concurrent requests)
- RAM: 64GB (for caching)
- Storage: 100GB (for multiple checkpoints)

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Quantization**
   - 8-bit: ~50% memory reduction, minimal quality loss
   - 4-bit: ~75% memory reduction, some quality loss

2. **Batched Inference**
   - Process multiple requests together
   - Better GPU utilization
   - Higher throughput

3. **Caching**
   - Cache model weights in memory
   - Cache common prompt prefixes
   - Reduce loading time
