But if you use

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: Oracle tools like SQL*Plus to modify Oracle Applications data, you risk destroying the integrity of your data and you lose the ability to audit Because Oracle Applications tables are interrelated, any change you make using an Oracle Applications form can update many tables at once.  But when you modify Oracle Applications data using anything other than Oracle Applications forms, you may change a row in one table without making corresponding changes in related tables.  If your tables get out of synchronization with each other, you risk retrieving erroneous information and you risk unpredictable results throughout When you use Oracle Applications forms to modify your data, Oracle Applications automatically checks that your changes are valid.  Oracle

For most countries, the Oracle localization team has When you write a formula, you specify for which of these purposes In Oracle Payroll, the system generates most of the formulas needed for payroll processing, in response to your entry of information about your earnings and deductions.  When necessary you can edit these Formulas for QuickPaint reports and assignment sets can be generated from criteria you enter in windows.  You can edit these generated formulas to add more functionality. Writing a Simple Payroll Calculation There are strict rules as to the words and punctuation you must use in

用户: 这里解释了哪些关键概念？
助手: a formula so that Oracle FastFormula can correctly perform the calculations and validation you require. To start with a simple example, suppose you wanted to calculate the pay value for the element Wage by multiplying the number of hours an employee works each week by his hourly rate.  You could write this wage = hours_worked * hourly_rate The first line is an Assignment statement that simply assigns a value to the element Wage.  The second line is a Return statement that passes back the Wage value to the payroll run. In this example, the Wage value is calculated, but it could be a constant value, such as:  wage = 200.  To calculate the Wage value, Oracle FastFormula needs to get values for the variables hours_worked and hourly_rate.  They are called variables because they can contain

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: different values depending, in this example, on which assignment the Both variables and constants can be one of three data types: The variables in the Wage example are numeric. We have said that Oracle FastFormula needs to get values for the variables hours_worked and hourly_rate.  There are three ways it can • it can receive them as input when the formula is called • it can find the values in the database from database items • it can use global values, which you enter in the Globals window To use a database item or global value in your formula, you simply refer to it by name.  You can browse through lists of database items in the Formulas window.  To use a value passed to the formula at run time, you must write an Inputs statement.

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: In our Wage example, suppose that hours_worked is an input value to the element Wage.  To pass the element input values to the formula during a payroll run, you define an Inputs statement, as follows: wage = hours_worked * hourly_rate The name you use in the Inputs statement must be the same as the name of the element input value, and multiple words must be joined by underscores.  In this example, the input value hours_worked is numeric.  If the input value is not numeric, you must tell Oracle FastFormula whether it is text or date.  For example: Suppose that hourly_rate is a standard rate taken from the Grade Rates table.  This is an example of a database item.  A database item has a label, or special piece of code, telling Oracle FastFormula the path to

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: take to access the data.  Oracle HRMS produces most of the database items you need without you taking any special action.  These items include both information unique to your enterprise, which you hold in flexfield segments, as well as standard information such as assignment In the Formulas window, you pick database items from a list.  You will see that the name of the database item for a grade rate called hourly_rate is actually grade_hourly_rate_value.  This is the name you By this naming convention, Oracle FastFormula knows that hourly_rate is a database item from the Grade Rate table.  But how does it know which hourly_rate to use from this table?  It works this out from the context the payroll run provides for each element entry.  The context • the employee and employee assignment.

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: Attention:  You should use an Inputs statement in preference to database items where possible because this is more efficient. See: Writing Efficient Payroll Calculation Formulas: page 1 – 19. Use global values to store information that does not change often, but you refer to frequently , such as Company Name, or company–wide percentages used to calculate certain types of bonus.  You define the global value and change its value using the Globals window. See: Using the Globals Window: page 1 – 12 Local variables exist in one formula only.  You can change the value of a local variable by assigning it a value in an Assignment statement.  In the Wage example, the variable wage itself is a local variable.  It receives a value within the formula by the Assignment statement:

用户: 这段讲了什么？
助手: wage = hours_worked * hourly_rate Note:  You cannot change the value of input values, database items, or global values within a formula. Writing More Complex Calculations The Assignment statement in the wages example above uses a simple multiplication to calculate the value of the wages element.  You can also use addition, subtraction, division, and a number of functions.  For bonus = GREATEST(days_at_work,163) + bonus_rate Here the function GREATEST tells Oracle FastFormula to use the value of the variable days_at_work, if it is greater than 163, and otherwise to The data type of variables and constants determines how operators and functions act on the values.  For example, the addition operator (+) can be used with numeric or text data, while division can be used with

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: There are special functions that convert variables from: The Assignment statement can use as many arithmetic operators and functions as you require.  Each function or calculation is one expression, and you can nest expressions to create more complex calculations.  You must use brackets to make clear to Oracle FastFormula the order in which the calculations are performed.  For example: ANNUAL_BONUS = trunc(((((salary_amount/100)* bonus_percentage)/183)*(days_between(end_period_date, Oracle FastFormula begins calculating inside the brackets and from left to right, in the following steps: 4. days_between (end_period_date, start_date) Notice that TRUNC is another function.  It rounds a numeric value down to the number of decimal places specified after the comma (two

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: In our simple Wage element example, only one value is returned, and it is calculated in the same way for every assignment.  However you may need to perform different calculations depending on the particular group of employee assignments, or the time of the year, or some other factors.  You can do this by incorporating conditions in your formula. The formula checks whether the condition (age < 20) is true or false.  If it is true, the formula processes the statement that follows the word THEN.  If the condition is not true, the formula ignores this statement and processes any statement that follows the word ELSE.  The ELSE In the example above, the condition compares a variable (age) to a constant (20).  The condition can be more complex, comparing

用户: 这段讲了什么？
助手: expressions that contain functions and arithmetic operators.  For IF (DAYS_BETWEEN(end_period_date, start_date)+1) >= threshold DAYS_BETWEEN is another function. We have seen two comparators:  less than (<) and greater than or equal to (>=).  A full list of the comparators you can use appears in the See: Oracle FastFormula Reference: page 1 – 29 There is a special type of condition called WAS DEFAULTED.  Use this to test whether a default value has been placed in an input value or database item.  Default values are placed using the Default statement. DEFAULT FOR hourly_rate IS 3.00 MESG = ’Warning: hourly rate defaulted’ In this example, if the database item hourly_rate is empty (NULL), the formula uses the default value of 3.00 and issues a warning message.

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: You can combine conditions using the logical operators AND, OR, NOT. • Use AND if you want an action to occur when more than one condition is true.  For example: IF  (days_between(end_period_date, start_date) + 1) >= 183 AND  employee_status = ’FULL TIME’ Use OR if you want an action to occur when any one of two or more conditions is true.  For example: Use NOT if you want an action to occur when a condition is not IF NOT (months_between(purchase_date, system_date) => 60 As with Assignment statements, you may need to use brackets to tell Oracle FastFormula in which order to test conditions.  By default, NOT has the highest precedence, followed by AND then OR.  So the IF   X = 6 AND NOT Y = 7 OR P >= 6 IF   (X = 6 AND (NOT Y = 7)) OR P >= 6

助手: How you use brackets can change dramatically the meaning of a Suggestion:  Use brackets whenever you create multiple conditions, so that the meaning of the formula is clear to other We have seen how to make conditions more complex.  You can also make the actions performed as complex as you like.  In our simple example above, the result of the condition was the assignment of a value to the variable training_allowance.  As well as assigning values, you can perform calculations and return values. For example, suppose you must check whether there are sufficient funds in a bank account before processing a withdrawal: new_balance = acct_balance – debit_amt message = ’Account No. ’ + acct + ’ – Insufficient Funds’ message2 = ’Account Balance is ’ + TO_TEXT(acct_balance)

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: Notice that you can return two variables in the same Return statement. Attention:  The brackets following THEN and ELSE are essential when you have multiple actions based on a condition. Without them, Oracle FastFormula processes the first statement conditionally and the other statements unconditionally. It is good practice to include comments in your formulas to explain to other people what the formula does. So, for example, you can name your formula: /*  Formula:  Attendance Bonus  */ and write an explanation of your formula: /*  Use this formula to calculate the annual bonus for clerical staff.  Employees receive either a percentage of their salary (if they have been present for 183 or more days in the last six months), or a pro rata bonus (if they

助手: have been in attendance for less than 183 days in the last Oracle FastFormula ignores everything between the comment delimiters:  /* and */.  You can place comments anywhere in a formula without affecting the formula’s performance. Warning:  Do not put a comment within a comment.  This causes Oracle FastFormula to return a syntax error. You can use a comment to explain what part of your formula does.  So, for example, you might want a comment explaining who decides the bonus_percentage /*  decided at board level */ You can also use comments to ‘comment out’ parts of the formula you do not currently want to use.  So, for example, you can include a fifth input of employee_status, ensuring that employees with a status of full

助手: time are awarded a bonus.  However, as you do not yet have a range of statuses, you do not currently need the fifth input. bonus_percentage /*  decided at board level  */ A valid formula has a well defined structure.  It is made up of comments and statements.  Oracle FastFormula ignores comments and carries out the instructions in the statements. We have already looked at four types of statement: There are two other types of statement you can use: Database items are named by the system when it creates them, and sometimes these names are too long to conveniently use in a formula. You cannot shorten the name of a database item (or a global value) itself, but you can set up an alternative shorter name to use within the ALIAS  as_overtime_qualifying_length_of_service AS ot_qls

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: In the rest of the formula, you can use the alias (in this example, ot_qls) as if it were the actual variable. Attention:  Using an Alias is more efficient than assigning the database item to a local variable with a short name. Use the Default statement to set a default value for an input value or a database item.  The formula uses the default value if the database item is empty or no input value is provided when you run the formula.  For DEFAULT FOR hourly_rate IS 3.00 MESG = ’Warning: hourly rate defaulted’ This example sets a default of 3.00 for the database item hourly_rate.  If hourly_rate is empty (NULL) in the database, the formula uses the default value of 3.00.  The formula uses the ’WAS DEFAULTED’ test to detect when a default value is used, in which case it issues a warning

助手: Attention:  You must use the Default statement for database items that can be empty.  The Database Items window includes a check box labelled Default Required.  This check box is checked for database items that can be empty.

In this case, if the formula references pay or input values (through the Inputs statement), each element must have pay and input values Defining an Element (HR Users), Oracle Human Resources User’s Guide Defining an Element (Payroll Users), Oracle Payroll User’s Guide Accessing Input Values in Payroll Formulas In many formulas for calculating pay, some or all of the information you need comes from the input values of the element. As a simple example, suppose you pay some salaried employees using a recurring element called Salary.  The Salary element has an input value called annual_salary.  You need a formula that divides the input

用户: 举个示例说明？
助手: Attention:  When you use an Inputs statement, you need to make sure that none of the input values can have a value of null because this causes the formula to fail.  You can avoid this problem by using the Default statement. Using an Inputs statement is the most efficient way to access the input values of the element with which the formula is associated.  However, if the formula uses the input values of other elements, it must access For example, if you want to use the input value annual_salary in the formula to calculate the element Bonus, you use the database item as IF Salary_annual_salary > 20000 Bonus = bonus_rate * (sales_achieved – sales_threshold) Notice that the database item name is in two parts: the input value (annual_salary) name prefixed by the element name (Salary).  This is

助手: the naming convention for the database items of element input values. Multiple Entries of Element Input Values When you define an element, you can enable multiple entries of the element within a payroll period. As a simple example, suppose you use the element Wages to pay some weekly–paid employees.  The Wages element has the input value hours_worked.  Each week, you regularly make five entries for the To calculate Wages, you can multiply the hours worked each day by the employee’s standard rate from the grade rates table, so that your Wages =  hours_worked * standard_rate During the payroll run, the formula fires five times, creating five separate pay values, one for each entry. Now consider using the database item Wages_hours_worked instead of

助手: an Inputs statement.  The database item for an entry value sums up all the entries made in the payroll period. This is a great convenience when referring to input value totals for a payroll period.  However, you must be sure that it is the totals that you want to use.  In this example, using the database item produces the Wages_hours_worked gives a single value that is the sum of the five entries in each weekly payroll period.  When the payroll runs, the formula fires five times, each time calculating wages using the total Attention:  If multiple entries are enabled for an element, be careful when using database items for the element’s entry values.  These database items hold the sum of all the entries. This includes entries made as indirect formula results during

用户: 这里解释了哪些关键概念？
助手: Database Items for Numeric Values Only Entry value database items are not created for input values with units of character, date, or time when multiple entries are enabled for the element.  This is because entry values of these types cannot be summed over the payroll period.  Only numeric values can be summed. Numeric input values are those with units of: Notice that other database items, such as default, minimum, or maximum, may be created for non–numeric input values. Writing Efficient Payroll Calculation Formulas The following statements are true as general guidelines for typical • The longer an element’s formula, the longer its processing time. • The more elements entered for an assignment, the longer its • One element associated with a lengthy formula usually processes

助手: faster than two related elements each associated with a short • The overall number of elements and formulas in the system has little effect on processing efficiency .  It is the number of elements per assignment that affects processing time. Use comments and white space freely when entering formulas.  This makes the formulas easier to read and understand, and has no effect on performance or memory usage.  Use indentation for the same reason, especially when you are using brackets to control the order of It is good practice to include the following information in a comment at • formula title and short statement of its purpose • description of formula inputs • list of variables and constants that may require updating • description of the input values of the element that receives the

Name length has no effect on performance or memory usage.  Use Aliases if the names of database items or global values are long. Use Input statements rather than database items whenever possible. This improves formula processing by as much as a factor of ten.  It speeds up the running of your payroll by eliminating the need to access the database for the input values. Salary = Salary_annual_salary / 12

People sometimes list at the top of a formula all the database items the formula might need, thinking this helps Oracle FastFormula process more quickly. However, this in fact slows processing by causing unnecessary The first example always causes a database fetch for Age whereas the second only fetches Age if Salary is less than 20000. Wherever possible, use balance dimensions for single assignments only

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: in formulas.  Multiple assignments require more calculation, leading to slower processing time.  The number of genuine multiple assignments in a payroll is not normally high, and the presence of a small number does not lead to any significant increase in overall processing time. There could be a problem, however, if you unnecessarily link balance dimensions for multiple assignments into general formulas. Writing Formulas for Element Skip Rules If your payroll policies require periodic or conditional processing of an element, you can write a formula to define when the run should process the element and when it should skip it.  For example, your • process the Union Fees element every three periods, or • process the Union Fees element every run unless the

助手: Using Oracle FastFormula for Validation You can use Oracle FastFormula to validate user entries into the element input values, and to user tables that you define.  In both cases, you must write and validate the formula before you define the element or table, so that you can select the formula from a list in the Element In the Formulas window, select formula type Element Input Validation When writing either type of formula, you must observe the following • There must be one input value, of type text, and it must be called • The formula must set and return a local variable giving the status of the validation (success or error).  This variable must be called formula_status and have the value ’s’ (success) or ’e’ • Optionally , the formula can also return a text variable giving an

助手: explanatory message.  The returned message variable must be called formula_message and can contain any text.  It can be returned with both successful and unsuccessful statuses. • The formula must not return any other results. For an element input value validation formula, you must also observe • You cannot use the element’s other pay and input values in the • You cannot return a value to another pay or input value. All entry values are stored in the database as text items.  Therefore, if you want to validate an entry value as a date or number, you must use Oracle FastFormula’s conversion function to convert the text into a date or number type variable.  For example: TO_DATE(entry_value,’DD–MON–YYYY’) The formula below checks that the entry value of the Salary element

To edit an assignment set formula, make a copy, as for a QuickPaint formula. Creating an Assignment Set, Oracle Human Resources User’s Guide Formulas comprise statements and comments.  Statements are instructions telling Oracle FastFormula how to process constants and variables, which are the basic information units in a formula.  The two key types of statement, which describe the formula’s calculations, are

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: the Assignment statement and the If statement.  These statements can include expressions, which manipulate constants and variables using arithmetic operators and functions.  The operators and functions you can use and the results they give depend upon the data type of the constants and variables.  In If statements, one expression can be compared to another using comparators to create a condition.  Conditions can be combined using logical operators. An example of each of these formula components is identified in the sample formula in Figure A – 2.  There are rules about how you use each of these components, and these rules are explained in this /*   Formula: Attendance Bonus  */ /*  Use  this formula to calculate the annual bonus for clerical staff.

Generally, you use constant and variables of the same data type in an expression.

用户: 举个示例说明？
助手: Constants are actual values you use in a formula.  Oracle FastFormula uses constants directly rather than holding them in a variable. There are three types of constant: Enter numeric constants without quotes.  Precede negative numbers with a minus sign (–).  Numbers may have a decimal component after a decimal point.  Do not use exponents and floating point (scientific) notations.  So, for example, you cannot use 2 constants.  Do not use commas or spaces in a number.  So, for example, you cannot use 10,000 or 10 000.00 numeric constants. Examples of valid numeric constants are: Enclose text constants in single quotes.  They may contain spaces.  You can represent the single quote character in a text constant by writing it twice (’’).  Note that this is not the same as the double quote (”).

用户: 这段讲了什么？
助手: Examples of valid text constants are: Date constants contain a date.  Enclose dates in single quotes and follow immediately with the word date, in brackets.  Use the format Examples of valid date constants are: You use variables in a formula to access information.  Variables can have The data type of a variable determines the type of information the You do not have to tell Oracle FastFormula what type you want a variable to be.  It works this out by seeing how you use the variable. For example, if you set a variable to ‘J. Smith’, Oracle FastFormula Oracle FastFormula also warns you if you try to perform any inconsistent operations, such as trying to add a number to a text string. There are three classes of variable in Oracle FastFormula: Variables that occur in a single formula only.

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: Values that can occur in any formula. Items that exist in the application’s database. The variable class determines how a formula uses it. Local variables occur in a single formula only.  You can change a local variable within the formula by assigning a value to it using an You can use local variables to store data in a formula.  You might want to hold data temporarily while you perform some other calculations, or to pass data back to the application. Below is an example showing the use of a local variable, annual_leave. /* Formula: Annual Leave Formula */ annual_leave = 20 + FLOOR (years_service/2) Global values are visible from within any formula.  Use global values to store information that does not change often, but you refer to

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: frequently , such as company name, or a location allowance that applies to many employees.  Global values are datetracked so you can make date effective changes ahead of time. You can never change a global value using a formula.  You alter global values using the Globals window.  The global value is the same across all formulas within a Business Group. See: Using the Globals Window: page 1 – 12 Below is an example using a global value. /* Formula: HAZARD ALLOWANCE FORMULA */ In this example, hazard_limit is a global value, which has been preset to reflect the point at which workers’ hazard payment increases. Database items exist in the application database and have a label, hidden from users, that the system uses to find the data. There are two types of database item:

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: • Static database items are predefined.  They include standard types of information, such as the sex, birth date, and work location of an employee, or the start and end dates of a payroll • Dynamic database items are generated from your definitions of: – grade rates and pay scale rates The name of your element, pay and input values, balance, absence type, grade rate, pay scale rate, or flexfield segment becomes part of the name of the generated database item.  This helps you identify the database item you need when you display a list of all available items in Definitions of flexfield segments only become database items when you initiate the Declare Descriptive Flexfield process from the Submit Requests window.  The other definitions become database items

助手: immediately when you save them to the database. Static Database Items: page  – 2 Dynamic Database Items: page  – 29. Database items are specific to the context in which you use them.  For example, using the database item hourly_rate gives the appropriate hourly rate for the specific assignment being processed. Like global values, database item values cannot be changed within a The rules that determine the data type and class of variables in a 1. The variable can be an input you name in the Inputs statement.  For If you do not specify the variable type in the statement, Oracle FastFormula assumes it is numeric. 2. If the variable is not an input, Oracle FastFormula looks in the list of global values the first time the variable occurs.  If the variable is

Again, if it is in the list, Oracle FastFormula 4. Finally , if Oracle FastFormula does not find the variable in either the global values or the database items, then it treats the variable as a local variable.  It determines the data type from the way you use Notice that if the variable is either a global value or a database item, then any attempt in your formula to alter the value of the variable If the variable is a local variable, it does not contain a value when it is first used in the formula.  Therefore you must assign a value to the variable before you try to use it in a condition or expression.  If you fail

用户: 这里解释了哪些关键概念？
助手: to assign a value, Oracle FastFormula fails when you attempt to verify Suggestion:  To avoid a failure, assign values to your local variables when they first appear in your formula. Variables have names comprising one or more words.  The words must be joined by underscores.  The words must each start with an alphabetic character (A–Z) and can be followed by alphanumeric characters (A–Z, 0–9).  The maximum size of a variable name is 80 Oracle FastFormula is not sensitive to case.  So, for example, the variable called EMPLOYEE_NAME is the same as the variable There are a number of words you cannot use as the names of variables. Any word consisting only of digits (that is, that could be treated as You may find that the name of a database item or global value is too

You set this up Expressions combine constants and variables with arithmetic operators (+, –, *, /) and functions to return a value of a certain data type.  For example, the expression (3 + 2) returns a value of 5, and is of The format of an expression is: SUBEXPRESSION [operator SUBEXPRESSION ...] This means that a number of ’subexpressions’ can combine in a single expression.  For example, the subexpressions (3 + 2) and MONTHS_BETWEEN(start_date, end_date) can combine in a (3 + 2) + MONTHS_BETWEEN(start_date, end_date) Expressions can also be used inside functions, as in the following salary = GREATEST(minimum_wage, (hourly_rate * hours_worked))

Operands in an expression are normally of the same data type, and this is normally the data type of the expression as a whole.  For example, in the following expression all the operands are numeric and the GREATEST(minimum_wage, (hourly_rate * hours_worked)) There are some exceptions to this.  For example: These have date operands, but return a numeric value. 4 + days_between(start_date, todays_date) An expression may contain arithmetic operators, which determine how variables and constants are manipulated.  For example, the operator ”+” indicates that two items should be added together. The division, subtraction, and multiplication operators can only be used with numeric operands.  The operands can be variables,

助手: constants, or subexpressions.  A formula error occurs if: • the result of subtraction is too large a negative number • the result of multiplication is too large • the second operand of a division evaluates to zero In both cases, ’too large’ here is determined by the normal limits in the The addition operator can be used with numeric or text operands.  If the result is greater than 240 characters, a formula error occurs. Notice that you enclose text constants in single forward quotes only (’), not double quotes (”).  For example, the statements: result_string = ’Pigs ’ + string1 + ’fly’ set the local variable result_string to ’Pigs will fly’. Oracle FastFormula provides functions that manipulate data in different ways.  Some functions work on only one type of data, some

助手: can work on two, others work on all three data types. The functions are described below, separated into the three data types and functions that convert between data types.  Where a function returns a different data type result than the data type of its operands, The general form of a function is: NAME OF FUNCTION(operand, operand, . .) Notice that, as with the operators, the operands of a function can be variables, constants, or complete expressions.  If the operand is a text string, you must enclose it in quote marks. GET_LOOKUP_MEANING(lookup_type , lookup_code) The GET_LOOKUP_MEANING function enables Oracle FastFormula to translate a lookup code into a meaning.  This can be used for any descriptive flexfield items or developer flexfield items that are based on

助手: GET_LOOKUP_MEANING (’ETH_TYPE’, PEOPLE_GB_ETHNIC_ORIGIN) GET_TABLE_VALUE(table_name, column_name, row_value [,effective The GET_TABLE_VALUE function returns the value of a cell in a user–defined table.  The three text operands, which identify the cell (table_name, column_name, and row_value), are mandatory.  The date operand is optional.  If it is not supplied, the function returns the cell value as of the effective date. You cannot use this function in formulas for user table validation or GET_TABLE_VALUE(’WAGE RATES’, ’Wage Rate’, Rate_Code) GREATEST(expr, expr [, expr] . . .) GREATEST_OF(expr, expr [, expr] . . .) The GREATEST function compares the values of all the text string operands.  It returns the value of the operand that is alphabetically last.

助手: If there are two or more operands that meet the criteria, Oracle LEAST(expr, expr [, expr] . . .) LEAST_OF(expr, expr [, expr] . . .) The LEAST function compares the values of all the text string operands.  It returns the value of the operand that is alphabetically first.  If there are two or more operands that meet the criteria, Oracle The LENGTH function returns the number of characters in the text The data type of the result of this function is numeric. The SUBSTRING function returns a substring of the text string operand expr of length n characters beginning at the mth character.  If you omit the third operand, the substring starts from m and finishes at the end of Note:  The first operand is a text operand.  The second and third operands are numeric operands.  The resulting data type

助手: Suggestion:  Always check string length before you start to /* Check that the tax code starts with GG */ (message = ’Tax code is too short’ IF substr( Tax_code, 1, 2) = ’GG’ THEN ... Or, to check if Tax_code is a string of at least two characters IF Tax_code LIKE ’GG%’ THEN ... The UPPER function convert a text string .to upper case. The ABS function returns the magnitude of a numeric operand n as a If the value of the operand is positive, its value returns unchanged.  If the operand is negative then the value’s sign inverts, and the value The FLOOR function returns the integer part of a numeric operand n. If the value of the operand contains information after the decimal point, Oracle FastFormula discards that information and returns a

助手: The GREATEST function compares all the operands and returns the The LEAST function compares all the operands and returns the The ROUND function rounds off a numeric value n to m decimal places.  The first operand is the value Oracle FastFormula rounds off, the second the number of places Oracle FastFormula rounds off to. The ROUNDUP function rounds a numeric value n up to m decimal places.  The first operand is the value to be rounded up, the second the number of places to round to.  If the digits after the rounding point are zero, the value is unchanged.  If the digits are not zero, the value is incremented at the rounding point. ROUND_UP(2.3401, 2) returns 2.35 ROUND_UP(2.3400, 2) returns 2.34. The TRUNC function rounds a numeric value n down to m decimal

助手: places.  The first operand is the value to be rounded down, the second the number of places to round to. Oracle FastFormula drops all digits (if any) after the specified The ADD_DAYS function adds a number of days to a date.  The resulting date accords with the calendar. Note:  Oracle FastFormula ignores any fractional part of the ADD_DAYS (’30–DEC–1990’, 6) returns 5–JAN–1991 The ADD_MONTHS function adds a number of months to a date.  The resulting date accords with the calendar. Note:  Oracle FastFormula ignores any fractional part of the The ADD_YEARS function adds a number of years to a date.  The resulting date accords with the calendar. Note:  Oracle FastFormula ignores any fractional part of the GREATEST(date1, date2[, date3] . . .)

用户: 这里解释了哪些关键概念？
助手: The GREATEST function compares all the operands and returns the LEAST(date1, date2 [, date3] . . .) The LEAST function compares all the operands and returns the earliest The DAYS_BETWEEN function returns the number of days between two dates.  If the later date is first, the result is a positive number.  If the earlier date is first, the result is a negative number.  The number returned is also based on the real calendar. The result is a numeric data type. DAYS_BETWEEN(’27–JUN–1995’, ’03–JUL–1995’) returns 5 The MONTHS_BETWEEN function returns the number of months between two dates.  If the later date is first, the result is a positive number.  If the earlier date is first, the result is a negative number.  The number returned is also based on the real calendar.

助手: If the result is not a whole number of months (that is, there are some days as well), the days part is shown as a decimal. The result is a numeric data type. Use data conversion functions to convert from one data type to another data type.  For example, you could have an expression returning a number value for salary, which you want to include in a printed message (that is, a character value).  To print the number as part of the message, you need to convert the value of salary from a number to a character value, using the TO_TEXT function. Converts the number n from number data type to text data type using the specified format.  This function is equivalent to the SQL TO_CHAR NUM_TO_CHAR(amount, ’$9,990.99’) This returns the amount with a leading dollar sign, commas every three

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: digits, and two decimal places.  Refer to the SQL Language Reference Manual for a full list of the valid number formats you can specify. Converts the expression expr of text data type to a date data type.  The text expression must be of the form ’DD–MON–YYYY’ if no format is provided.  The day and year must be in numeric form.  For example: date_1 = TO_DATE (’12 January 89’, ’DD Month YY’) date_1 = TO_DATE (’12 January Nineteen–Eighty–Nine’, Note:  When assigning date variables from constants it is much Converts the expression expr of text data type to a number data type. The expression must represent a valid number.  So for example, you cannot convert an expression such as ‘Type 24’ but you can convert the TO_TEXT(n) TO_TEXT (date1 [, format]) TO_CHAR(n) TO_CHAR( date1 [, format])

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: • the number n from number data type to text data type • the date date1 from date data type to text data type.  The optional format should be a text string like ’DD–MON–YYYY’.  This is the birthdate = ’21–JAN–1960’ (date) mesg = ’Birthdate is: ’ + TO_CHAR  (birthdate) /* sets mesg to ’Birthdate is: 21–JAN–1960’ */ mesg = ’Birthdate is: ’ + TO_CHAR (birthdate, /* sets mesg to ’Birthdate is: 21–JAN–60’ */ mesg = ’Birthdate is: ’ + TO_CHAR (birthdate, /* sets mesg to ’Birthdate is: 21 January Nineteen–Sixty’ */ Function calls to PL*SQL packaged functions provide useful extensions to Oracle FastFormula.  The following functions have been registered for use in GB legislative formulas: Calculate car benefit, year to date Count of assignments an employee has

A formula may contain any number of comments, which can be placed Comments start with a slash asterisk (/*) sequence, and finish with an asterisk slash sequence (*/).  Oracle FastFormula ignores all text within Warning:  Do not put a comment within a comment.  This causes Oracle FastFormula to return a syntax error.

助手: Statements are instructions that Oracle FastFormula carries out.  There are six types of statement you can use: An If statement can have Assignment, Return, and other If statements nested within it, enabling you to build up powerful formulas. The format of the Alias statement is: where varname1 is the name of an existing database item or global value, and varname2 is a unique name not currently known to the system nor used previously in your formula. Use the Alias statement to define another name, or alias, for existing variables in the system.  You can declare aliases for database items and Alias statements must appear before any other statements in a formula. The format of the Default statement is: DEFAULT FOR <varname> IS <constant>

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: where varname is an input value or database item, and constant is a constant value matching the data type of varname. Use the Default statement to set a default value for an input value or database item.  The formula uses the default value if the database item is empty or the input value is not provided when you run the formula. You can use the Default statement with the ’WAS DEFAULTED’ test to detect when a default value has been used.  For example: DEFAULT FOR hourly_rate IS 3.00 MESG = ’Warning: hourly rate defaulted’ This example sets a default of 3.00 for the database item hourly_rate.  If hourly_rate is empty (NULL) in the database, the formula uses the default value of 3.00 and issues a warning message. Attention:  You must use the Default statement for database

用户: 举个示例说明？
助手: items that can be empty.  The Database Items window includes a check box labelled Default Required.  This check box is checked for database items that can be empty.  The Database Items window appears when you click the Show Items button The format of the Inputs statement is: INPUTS ARE varname1(data type)[, varname2 (data type)] ... Use the Inputs statement to pass input values from an element into a You do not need to declare the type of number variables because this is the default data type.  You can define up to 15 input values for an The Inputs statement must appear before the other formula statements • any Alias statements, which must always be at the top of the • any Default statements that provide default values for input

用户: 这段讲了什么？
助手: Always use the Inputs statement to retrieve the input values of the element associated with the formula.  Using a database item forces the formula to execute the code and work out the path to retrieve the For example, the formula below: wage = wage_rate * hours_worked is more efficient than the second formula: wage = wage_wage_rate * wage_hours_worked Use the Assignment statement to set a value for a local variable.  The format of the Assignment statement is: Oracle FastFormula evaluates the expression on the right hand side of the statement, and places its result in the variable you name in the left hand side.  The left side of an Assignment statement must always be a local variable because a formula can only change the value of local

助手: Use the If statement to set a condition that controls whether a sequence There are two clauses in the If statement: the THEN and ELSE clauses. • The IF statement lets you check one or more conditions. • The THEN clause lets you define what to do if the conditions are • The ELSE clause lets you define what to do if the conditions are The If statement is the only statement that can have other statements nested within it, including other IF statements. The format of the If statement is: [logical operator] [NOT] condition The If statement can consist of a single condition, or two or more conditions combined with logical operators.  A logical operator is either AND or OR.  These have the effect of combining the conditions • The AND operator means that if both conditions are true, then

用户: 这里解释了哪些关键概念？
助手: • The OR operator means that if either condition is true, then their Also, each condition can be preceded by the NOT operator, which inverts the truth of the condition.  That is, if condition X is true, then A condition itself has a valid format.  This is: expression comparator expression The values represented by each expression are compared together in the way described by the comparator.  The two expressions must both return the same data type.  There are eight comparators, and the way they work depends upon the data type of the values they are Equals = All The condition is true if both expressions have exactly the same value.  For text, the case of the expression must be the same. So, for example, ’Smith’ is not equal to All The condition is true if the result of the first

用户: 这里解释了哪些关键概念？
助手: expression does NOT have the same value as the result of the second expression. Greater than > All The condition is true if the first expression is alphabetically after, or has a numerically greater value, or a later date than the Less than < All The condition is true if the first expression is alphabetically before, or has a numerically smaller value, or an earlier date than the second expression. All The condition is true if either the greater than OR the equal to comparator returns a All The condition is true if either the less than OR the equal to comparator returns a true Like LIKE Text The condition is true if the two text expressions match according to the rules of the LIKE syntax.  You can include Wildcards in the text to allow searching for

用户: 这段讲了什么？
助手: text that matches a pattern, or words that begin with a certain sequence of letters. –  percent sign (%) matches any number of –  underscore (_) matches a single character Text The condition is true if the two text expressions do NOT match according to There is a special comparator called WAS DEFAULTED that you can use to test database items and input values.  If there is no value available for an input value or database item, the formula uses a default value.  The condition containing the WAS DEFAULTED comparator is True if a default value was used.  For example: DEFAULT FOR employee_middle_name IS ’ ’ IF  employee_middle_name WAS DEFAULTED If you group more than one statement under the THEN or ELSE clauses, enclose the group of statements within brackets, that is ( and ).

用户: 它与 Payroll 有什么关系？
助手: In the absence of brackets, Oracle FastFormula conditionally executes only the statement that immediately follows the THEN or ELSE clause. Any other statements are executed unconditionally.  For example, when the following formula runs, High_salary is always set to Y: To prevent this, use brackets as follows: Use the Return statement to return values in local variables to the application.  Oracle FastFormula can pass back any number of variables.  The variable does not need to contain a value. /* Formula: LONDON ALLOWANCE FORMULA */ INPUTS ARE this_months_extra (number) London_allowance = (grade_pay/20 + this_months_extra) Notice that you do not have to declare the data type of local variables in the Return statement (as the formula already knows the data type).

用户: 这段讲了什么？
助手: Oracle FastFormula stops executing the formula when it reaches the Return statement.  Any statements after the Return statement are When you have created or edited a formula in the Formula window, you choose the Verify button to compile it. If you need to compile many formulas at the same time, you can run the Bulk Compile Formulas process in the Submit Requests window. For example, you run this process when you upgrade your legislative information, which includes formulas. There are two types of error that can occur when using Oracle • Verify–time errors occur in the Formulas window when you run the formula verification.  An error message explains the nature Common verify–time errors are syntax errors resulting from • Run–time errors occur when a problem arises while a formula is

助手: running.  The usual cause is a data problem, either in the formula or in the application database. Below is a list of the basic Oracle FastFormula errors that can An uninitialized local variable is one that has no value when the formula runs.  This causes an error in all statements except the Return This formula fails with an ’Uninitialized variable’ message (for the variable tax) if the tax band is set to 2000. Dividing a number by zero is an operation that provides no logical result.  If this situation ever arises, Oracle FastFormula passes a code indicating an error back to the application (the application then takes Always check for the possibility of a divide by zero error if there is any chance it could occur.  For example, the formula: x = salary/contribution_proportion

用户: 公式写法是什么？
助手: produces an error if the contribution proportion is set to zero.  In this formula, check for the divide by zero condition as follows: IF   contribution_proportion = 0 THEN (message = ’The contribution proportion is not valid.’ ELSE x = salary/contribution_proportion A database item supposed to be in the database was not found.  This represents an error in the application data. The database item definition within the application caused more than one value to be fetched from the database. This can occur for a variety of reasons such as: • exceeding the maximum allowable length of a string (which is • rounding up a number to an excessive number of places, for • using an invalid date, for example, 39–DEC–1990. This occurs only when database item contains a bad number.
