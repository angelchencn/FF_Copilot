Chapter 1
Overview
1  Overview
Overview of Using Formulas  
Oracle Fast Formula is a simple way to write formulas using English words and basic mathematical functions. You can
use information from your database in formulas without learning the database structure or a programming language.
Each formula usage summarized in this topic corresponds to one or more formula types, requiring specific formula
inputs and outputs.
The formulas delivered in Oracle HCM Cloud contain English language names, but you can write formulas in other
languages. You can provide formula names and descriptions in any language. Formula text isn't translated, but can
handle non-English user-defined elements, input values, or balances. For example, if you define an element name in
Chinese, the base element name is stored in Chinese. If you create a formula, it can have variable names or string values
in other languages and character sets like Chinese.
Calculate Payrolls
You can write payroll calculations and skip rules for elements to represent earnings and deductions.
You can do these tasks using fast formulas:
â¢ Control the repetition of a payroll flow.
â¢ Control when elements are processed in a payroll run.
â¢ Define a set of people for payroll processing, data entry, or reporting.
â¢ Validate one or more element entry values. Provide a default value for an element entry value, or calculate entry
values based on the user's entries in other entry values.
â¢ Validate entries in user-defined tables.
â¢ Proration formulas control how payroll runs prorate element entries when they encounter an event such as a
mid-period change in an element entry value.
â¢ Associate more than one payroll formula with each element to perform different processing for employee
assignments with different statuses.
â¢ Transformation formulas convert inbound data into a format that HCM Data Loader understands.
â¢ Configure payment method preferences. For example, you can limit the number and types of payment
methods.
Benefits Administration
You can use formulas to structure your benefit plans. Formulas provide a flexible alternative to the delivered business
rules. Use formulas to configure:
â¢ Date calculations, such as enrollment start and end dates, rate or coverage start and end dates, waiting periods
and enrollment periods, or action item due dates
â¢ Calculations of rate and coverage amount, minimum and maximum, or upper and lower limits
â¢ Certification requirements

Chapter 1
Overview
â¢ Partial month and proration calculations
â¢ Eligibility and participation evaluation
For example, you can write a formula to calculate benefits eligibility for those cases where the provided eligibility
criterion doesn't accommodate your particular requirements.
Note:  For more information, see Benefits Fast Formula Reference Guide (1456985.1) on My Oracle Support at https://
support.oracle.com.
Define Configuration for Compensation
Here's what you can modify using formulas and add flexibility to existing compensation plan configuration:
â¢ Start and end dates for compensation allocations under individual compensation plans
â¢ Person selection, hierarchy determination, column default values, and currency selection for workforce
compensation plans
â¢ The source of items displayed in total compensation statements
Define Formulas to Create Rule Templates for Time and Labor
Use formulas with time repository rule templates to create rules. The formulas contain delivered combinations of
rule parameters and output results. You can use one formula with multiple rule templates by varying the template
configuration.
When creating a rule template, you select a formula name, and then configure the parameter type and display name of
the parameters and variables. You don't have to redo the entire formula statement to determine what details to change
to achieve a particular outcome.
Here's what you can use formulas to apply in Time and Labor:
â¢ Logic for processing or calculating time
â¢ Parameters that enable rules to pass values to the formula for use in calculations
â¢ Output variables that the formula uses to return calculation results to the rules
For example, the Period Maximum Hours Template uses the WFM_PERIOD_MAXIMUM_TIME_ENTRY_RULE formula to
compare reported time category hours to defined maximum hours.

Writing Formulas
2  Writing Formulas
Overview of Writing Formulas  
Writing fast formulas enables you to perform a wide variety of tasks using English words and basic mathematical
functions. There are several techniques that you can use to ensure your formulas are easy to read, use, and understand.
You write fast formulas to validate or calculate data for payroll and other Oracle Fusion applications.
This table lists the key aspects of writing fast formulas.
Key Aspects Description
Using the expression editor
 
Use the expression editor with these formula types:
 
â¢ Deduction component groups
â¢ Deduction component detail groups
â¢ Payroll relationship groups
â¢ Work relationship groups
Use these formula types when creating dynamic object groups. Object groups define subsets of
deduction components or people for processing or reporting.
 
Using formula text
 
Most formula types use the text editor to define formulas. The text editor is more flexible than the
expression editor. Here's what you can do with the text editor:
 
â¢ Add database items applicable to the formula type
â¢ Use functions to manipulate data
â¢ Use user-defined global values
Database items are read-only variables that you can use to get application data without having
knowledge of the underlying data model, and writing queries to get the data.
 
The input values that you have passed and the output values returned depend upon the context in
which you're using the formula. The names and types of these values are defined in many scenarios,
 so refer the appropriate product documentation.
 
Improving performance
 
Here's what you can do to improve performance:
 
â¢ Shorten your formulas.
â¢ Don't refer to database items until needed.
â¢ Use an ALIAS instead of assigning a database item to a local variable.
â¢ Use input statements instead of database items.
â¢ Leave a WHILE loop as early as possible.
â¢ Limit use of CHANGE_CONTEXT blocks.
â¢ Change as many contexts as possible in one CHANGE_CONTEXTS block instead of having
CHANGE_CONTEXTS blocks inside other CHANGE_CONTEXTS blocks.
3
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 2
Writing Formulas
Key Aspects Description
â¢ Don't use CHANGE_CONTEXTS to set contexts that you would reasonably expect to be set
already, and aren't going to change.
â¢ Use the database item that would retrieve the required data. Some database items are used in
reporting, and are unsuitable for use in formulas because they return a lot of inefficient data.
Avoid these database items in formulas because they require more complex formulas to get the
required data, and they make performance worse.
Avoiding compilation errors
 
Compile a modified formula before using it. Here's what you can do to avoid common compilation
errors:
 
â¢ Look for syntax errors, such as using IF1 instead of IF.
â¢ Ensure that the statement order is correct. For example ALIAS, DEFAULT, or INPUT statements
come after other statements.
â¢ Don't misuse assignment statements by assigning a value to a database item.
â¢ Don't misuse the ALIAS statement. It can only be used for database items.
â¢ Don't misuse DEFAULT statements. You must specify a DEFAULT statement for a variable other
than an input or database item.
â¢ Look out for missing DEFAULT statements. Database items that have a default value specified
must contain a DEFAULT statement.
Avoiding execution errors
 
Here's what you can do to avoid common execution errors:
 
â¢ Ensure that variables are initialized. For example, a variable initialized inside an IF block might be
initialized when it's used.
â¢ Verify that your formula calculations won't end up dividing a number by zero.
â¢ Ensure that the formula compiler can find the data.
â¢ Ensure that the value that your formula generates doesn't exceed the permissible range.
Improve Formula Performance  
Use various approaches to ensure that your formulas are easy to read, use, understand, and processed efficiently.
Variable Names and Aliases
Use concise and meaningful variable names. If the names of database items are long, you can use aliases. The length of
database item name doesn't impact the performance or memory usage of a formula.
Inputs Statements
Tip:  The best approach is to use INPUTS statements rather than database items whenever possible. You don't have to
access the database for input variables, which in turn speeds up your payroll run.
Here's an example of a formula without the INPUTS statement:
SALARY = SALARY_ANNUAL_SALARY / 12
4
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 2
Writing Formulas
RETURN SALARY
Here's how you can use the INPUTS statement efficiently:
INPUTS ARE ANNUAL_SALARY
SALARY = ANNUAL_SALARY / 12
RETURN SALARY
CHANGE_CONTEXTS Statement
Tip:  The best approach is to use CHANGE_CONTEXTS statement only when required, because CHANGE_CONTEXTS can cause
database item values to be fetched again from the database.
You can perform multiple context changes using a single CHANGE_CONTEXTS statement, instead of calling CHANGE_CONTEXTS
from other CHANGE_CONTEXTS blocks.
For example, use a single CHANGE_CONTEXTS statement in the first formula, which is efficient than the second formula:
CHANGE_CONTEXTS(EFFECTIVE_DATE = l_eff_date, AREA1= 'California')
(
 /*Do something here*/
)
CHANGE_CONTEXTS(EFFECTIVE_DATE = l_eff_date)
(
CHANGE_CONTEXTS(AREA1 = 'California')
 (
 /*Do something here*/
 )
)
Don't use the CHANGE_CONTEXTS statement to set contexts that you would reasonably expect to be already set.
For example, the PERSON_ID context is generally already set in a formula that processes person information. If this
context isn't set, then GET_CONTEXT doesn't fetch any value. GET_CONTEXT only returns the default value of -1. This code
doesn't achieve anything:
l_person_id = GET_CONTEXT(PERSON_ID, -1)
l_effective_date = GET_CONTEXT(EFFECTIVE_DATE, '0001-01-01 00:00:00)(DATE))
CHANGE_CONTEXTS(PERSON_ID = l_person_id, EFFECTIVE_DATE = l_effective_date)
(
 /*Do something here*/
)
Database Items
Tip:  The best approach is to retain only the required database items in a formula. Don't refer to database items in
a formula unless it's absolutely required. Sometimes a formula might contain databases that it doesn't need, which
causes the formula to make unnecessary database calls. As a result, the efficiency of the formula is impacted.
In this example, the use of database items always causes a database fetch for AGE.
S = SALARY
A = AGE
IF S < 20000 THEN
IF A < 20 THEN

Writing Formulas
 TRAINING_ALLOWANCE = 30
ELSE
 TRAINING_ALLOWANCE = 0
In this example, the use of database items fetches AGE only if salary is less than 20000:
IF SALARY < 20000 THEN
IF AGE < 20 THEN
 TRAINING_ALLOWANCE = 30
ELSE
 TRAINING_ALLOWANCE = 0
Database Items for HCM Extracts
Some database items are intended only for HCM Extracts reporting. These database items return a high amount of data
and retrieve it inefficiently when used in a formula.
For example, an HCM Extracts database item retrieves information for all employees on the application, or complete
information of a particular employee since the start of employment. This data retrieval is fine for reporting as reports
process lots of data. Formulas usually process small amount of data limited to specific cases. HCM Extracts allow extra
conditions to be added to limit the data returned, but formulas don't.
With these database items, more complex formulas are required to get the right data and the performance
of the formulas is extremely poor because of the large data volumes. For example, the array database
item PER_EXT_ALL_PHONE_AREA_CODE returns all phone area codes as of an effective date. Together with
PER_EXT_ALL_PHONE_PERSON_ID, and PER_EXT_ALL_PHONE_TYPE, it's possible to get a person's home phone's area code.
But for a simpler formula and better performance, you can use the PER_PER_HOME_PHONE_AREA_CODE database item to
retrieve the home phone's area code. PER_PER_HOME_PHONE_AREA_CODE uses PERSON_ID and EFFECTIVE_DATE contexts to get
its data. PER_EXT_ALL_PHONE_AREA_CODE only uses the EFFECTIVE_DATE context.
While Loop
Use an EXIT statement or a change to the loop condition to leave a WHILE loop immediately once you complete your task.
For example, don't continue when you have already found a single item that you were looking for.
Formula Logging
Formula logging can help during implementation when developing formulas. It can also help with problem diagnosis.
When investigating problems logged through a support service request, Oracle may ask for logging information.
Although logging can be very useful, the logging process may impact performance and slow down processing in
general. Other processes waiting on resources utilized by the logging process, may take longer to complete or be
delayed in starting.
It is advisable to remove unnecessary logging statements once the purpose is served. If there is a need to retain logging
statements for diagnostic purposes then it is suggested that they are executed conditionally, for example:
debug = 0 
if (debug = 1) then 
( 
 /* Log statements here. */ 
)
When logging is required, set debug = 1 and recompile the formula.
Note:  Don't forget to disable logging when finished.

Writing Formulas
Formula Compilation Errors  
Compilation errors are displayed in the Fast Formulas page after you compile the formula. The compiler stops the
compilation process when it encounters an error. Error messages display the line number and the type of error.
Common Compilation Errors
Here's some of the common formula compilation errors.
Formula Compilation Error Description
Syntax Error
 
The formula text violates the grammatical rules for the formula language. For example, if you use IF1
instead of IF in an IF statement.
 
Incorrect Statement Order
 
ALIAS, DEFAULT, or INPUT statements come after other statements.
 
Misuse of ASSIGNMENT Statement
 
Occurs when any of these conditions exist:
 
â¢ An ASSIGNMENT assigns a value to a database item.
â¢ A context is assigned a value externally to a CHANGE_CONTEXTS statement.
â¢ The formula assigns a value to a non-context variable within a CHANGE_CONTEXTS statement.
You can use CHANGE_CONTEXTS statements in a formula.
 
Misuse of ALIAS Statement
 
You can use an ALIAS statement only for a database item.
 
Missing DEFAULT Statement
 
A database item that specifies a default value must have a DEFAUL T statement.
 
Misuse of DEFAULT Statement
 
You specify a DEFAUL T statement for a variable other than as an input or a database item.
 
Uninitialized Variable
 
The compiler detects that a variable is uninitialized when used. The compiler can't do this in all cases.
This error often occurs when the formula includes a database item that requires contexts that the
formula type doesn't support. The formula treats the database item as a local variable. For example,
balance database items require the PAYROLL_REL_ACTION_ID, PAYROLL_ASSIGNMENT_ID and CALC_
BREAKDOWN_ID contexts. Typically, you use these statements in formulas of type Oracle Payroll.
 
Missing Function Call
 
The compiler doesn't recognize a function call. The combination of return type, function name, and
parameter types doesn't match any available function.
 
Incorrect Operator Usage
 
An instance of a formula operator use doesn't match the permitted uses of that operator.
 
For example, the + operator has two permitted uses. The operands are both of data type NUMBER, or
both of data type TEXT.
 
Inconsistent Data Type Usage
 
The formula uses a formula variable of more than one data type. Or the formula uses a database item
or context with the wrong data type.

Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 2
Writing Formulas
Formula Compilation Error Description
 
For example, Variable A is assigned a NUMBER value at the start of the formula, but is assigned a TEXT
value later in the formula.
 
EXIT Statement Not Within WHILE Loop
 
A condition that eventually becomes false or an EXIT call for exiting the loop doesn't exist.
 
Misuse of Context
 
The formula uses a variable as a context, or a context as a variable.
 
For example, a formula assigns a value to AREA1 as an ordinary variable, but later uses AREA1 as a
context in a GET_CONTEXT call.
 
Formula Execution Errors  
Fast formula execution errors occur when a problem arises while a formula is running. Typically, data-related issues
cause these errors either in the formula or in the application database.
Formula Execution Errors
Here's some of the formula execution errors.
Formula Execution Error Description
Uninitialized Variable
 
When the formula compiler can't fully determine if a variable or context is initialized, it generates a
code to test if the variable is initialized.
 
When the formula runs, the code displays an error if the variable or context isn't initialized.
 
Divide by Zero
 
Raised when a numeric value is divided by zero.
 
No Data Found
 
Raised when a non-array type database item unexpectedly fails to return any data. If the database item
can't return data, then it should provide a default value.
 
You can specify a default value using a DEFAULT statement. An error in formula function code can also
cause this error message.
 
Too Many Rows
 
Raised when a non-array type database item unexpectedly returns more than a single row of data. The
cause is an incorrect assumption made about how the data is being accessed.
 
An error in the formula function code can also cause this error message.
 
NULL Data Found
 
Raised when a database item unexpectedly returns a NULL data value. If the database item can return a
NULL value, then it provides a default value.

Chapter 2
Writing Formulas
Formula Execution Error Description
Note:
Some database items can't return a NULL value. If the database items can return a NULL value, then
you can provide a default value for that database item.
 
Value Exceeded Allowable Range
 
Raised for a number of reasons, such as exceeding the maximum allowable length of a string.
 
Invalid Number
 
Raised when a formula attempts to convert a nonnumeric string to a number.
 
User Defined Function Error
 
Raised from within a formula function. The error message text is provided as part of the formula error
message.
 
External Function Call Error
 
A formula function returns an error, but doesn't provide any additional information to the formula
code. The function may have sent error information to the logging destination for the executing code.
 
Function Returned NULL Value
 
A formula function returns a NULL value.
 
Too Many Iterations
 
A single WHILE loop, or a combination of WHILE loops has exceeded the maximum number of
permitted iterations. This error is raised to terminate loops that can never end, which indicates a
programming error within the formula.
 
Array Data Value Not Set
 
The formula tries to access an array index that has no data value. This error occurs in the formula code.
 
Invalid Type Parameter for WSA_EXISTS
 
You specify an invalid data type in the WSA_EXISTS call.
 
Incorrect Data Type For Stored Item
 
When retrieving an item using WSA_GET, the actual data type doesn't match that of the stored item.
This error occurs within the calling formula.
 
Called Formula Not Found
 
The called formula isn't found when attempting to call a formula from a formula. This error may occur
due to an issue in the calling formula, or because of installation issues.
 
Recursive Formula Call
 
An attempt was made to call a formula from itself. The call could be made directly or indirectly from
another called formula. Calling a formula in a recursive manner isn't permitted.
 
Input Data Has Different Types in Called
and Calling Formulas
 
When calling a formula from a formula, the input data type within the called formula doesn't match the
data type specified in the calling formula.
 
Output Has Different Types In Called and
Calling Formulas
 
When calling a formula from a formula, the output data type within the called formula doesn't match
the data type specified in the calling formula.
 
Too Many Formula Calls
 
When a formula calls another formula in its text, resulting in a hierarchy. The maximum depth of the
hierarchy is 10.

Fast Formula Components
3  Fast Formula Components
Overview of Using Fast Formula Components  
When you're developing a fast formula, you must understand the formula language, the rules that the application
imposes on the fast formula, and the calculation requirements.
Create fast formulas using these components:
â¢ Assignment statements
â¢ Return statements
â¢ Variables
â¢ Input statements
â¢ Expressions
â¢ Conditions
â¢ Comments
Note:  Other topics explain additional components that you can use in fast formulas. These include literals, database
items, working storage area, calls to other formulas, functions, and operators.
Let's look at an example to understand how each component is used in a fast formula. Suppose you want to calculate
the pay value for the WAGEelement by multiplying the number of hours an employee works each week by the hourly
rate. Here's how you can write the formula in this example:
WAGE = HOURS_WORKED * HOURLY_RATE
RETURN WAGE
Assignment Statements
An assignment statement assigns a value to the WAGE element.
Return Statements
A return statement passes the WAGE value back to the payroll run. You can use a return statement to stop the formula
execution without passing any values.
Variables
Variables are of these classes:
â¢ Input variables appear in INPUTS statements and bring values into a fast formula.
â¢ Output variables appear in RETURN statements and return values from a fast formula. A variable can be both
an input and output.
â¢ Local variables are only used within one formula.
15
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 3
Fast Formula Components
You can change a local variable within the formula by assigning a value to it using an assignment statement. To
calculate the WAGE value, the fast formula needs to get the value for the HOURS_WORKED variable.
You can use local variables to store data in a fast formula. You might want to hold data temporarily while you perform
some other calculations, or pass data back to the application. Here's an example of the ANNUAL_LEAVE variable.
/* Formula: Annual Leave Formula */
IF YEARS_SERVICE >= 10
THEN
ANNUAL_LEAVE = 25
ELSE
ANNUAL_LEAVE = 20 + FLOOR (YEARS_SERVICE/2)
RETURN ANNUAL_LEAVE
Input Statements
You can use HOURS_WORKED as an input value of the WAGE element. To pass the element input values to the fast formula
during processing, define an input statement like this:
INPUTS ARE HOURS_WORKED
WAGE = HOURS_WORKED * HOURLY_RATE
RETURN WAGE
Note:  This is a payroll application example. The name used in the input statement must be the same as the name
of the element input value. Multiple words must be joined by underscores. Other input statements that have nothing
to do with elements would have their own rules for formula input variables. In this example, the HOURS_WORKED input
variable is numeric. If the input variable isn't numeric, you must specify the type. For example,
INPUTS ARE START_DATE (DATE)
Expressions
Each function or calculation is one expression. You can nest expressions to create more complex calculations. You can
use brackets to control the order in which calculations are done.
The formula evaluates expressions within the brackets first. Within nested brackets, evaluation proceeds from the least
inclusive set to the most inclusive set. If you don't use brackets, the formula evaluates expression in this order:
â¢ Multiplication, Division
â¢ Addition, Subtraction
Note:  For same priority, the formula evaluates the expression from left to right.
Expressions combine constants and variables with operators (+, -, *, /), array methods, and functions to return a value
of a certain data type. For example, the expression (3 + 2) returns a value of 5, and is a NUMBER data type. The format of
an expression is:
SUBEXPRESSION [operator SUBEXPRESSION ...]
You can combine a number of sub-expressions into a single expression. For example, you can combine the sub-
expressions (3 + 2) and MONTHS_BETWEEN(start_date, end_date) into a single expression as follows:
(3 + 2) + MONTHS_BETWEEN(start_date, end_date)
You can also use expressions inside functions, such as:
16
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 3
Fast Formula Components
salary = GREATEST(minimum_wage, (hourly_rate * hours_worked))
Operands in an expression are usually of the same data type, which is the data type of the expression as a whole. Here's
an example of an expression in which all the operands are numeric and the expression itself is numeric:
GREATEST(MINIMUM_WAGE, (HOURLY_RATE * HOURS_WORKED)) + BONUS
BONUS is the operand for the above expression. The return value is GREATEST. The arguments for GREATEST are separate
expressions.
Conditions
You can use conditions to process expressions based on whether a certain condition occurs. For example:
TRAINING_ALLOWANCE = 0 
IF (AGE < 20) THEN
TRAINING_ALLOWANCE = 30
This formula checks if the condition (AGE < 20) is true or false. If it's true, the formula processes the statement that
follows the word THEN. If the condition is false, the formula ignores this statement.
Comments
Use comments to explain all or part of a fast formula. Also, you can change some formula lines into comments until
they're ready to be used. You can place comments anywhere within a formula. The beginning of a fast formula should
contain these comments:
â¢ The formula title and a short purpose statement.
â¢ A description of the formula inputs.
â¢ A list of variables and literals that may require updating.
â¢ An explanation of the formula's calculation.
â¢ The dates of any modifications, the name of the person modifying the formula, and the reason for the change.
Multi-Line Comments
Multi-line comments are designated by the comment delimiters of /* and */. Anything written inside these delimiters is
a comment.
Note:  Do not put a multi line comment within a multi line comment, because it causes a syntax error when you
compile the formula.
Single Line Comments
Fast formula also supports single line comments. The # character is used for the start of single line comments. The #
character itself and any text after it to the end of the line are ignored.
Comments Example:
# This line is a single line comment and will be ignored.
 
/*
 * This is a multi-line comment.
 */

a = 1 # Ignore the # character and everything after it on the line.
 
b = '####' # b is the string ####. The remainder of the line is ignored. 
 
return a, b
Types of Variables  
Formula variables can have values that change frequently. The variable's data type indicates the type of information the
variable holds. The fast formula determines how you can use the variable.
For example, if you set a variable to 'J. Smith', the fast formula interprets it as a TEXT variable. The application displays a
warning if you try to perform any inconsistent operations, such as trying to add a number to a text string.
Variables can be of the following types:
â¢ Input variables appear in INPUTS statements and bring values into a fast formula.
â¢ Output variables appear in RETURN statements and return values from a fast formula. A variable can be both an
input and output.
â¢ Local variables are only used within one fast formula.
You can change variable values by using an assignment statement and by referencing them within expressions.
However, if you reference a variable to which you didn't assign a value, the fast formula returns an error.

Formula Statements  
You use formula statements to provide instructions that you want your formula to carry out. When working with
statements, it's important to have knowledge of the different statement types, the required order, and how to group
statements.
Statement Types
Here are the statements that you can use in your formulas to provide instructions.
Statement Statement Form Description and Example
ALIAS
 
ALIAS name1 AS name2
 
Provides a different name for a database item
or global value. Sometimes the database item
names that the application provides are too
long to use in a formula.

Statement Statement Form Description and Example
Use the ALIAS statement to shorten the name
of a database item. Once the ALIAS is created,
 use it instead of the database item name. Using
an alias is more efficient than assigning the
database item to a local variable with a short
name.
 
ALIAS OVERTIME_QUALIFYING_LENGTH_OF_
SERVICE AS OT_QLS
ASSIGNMENT
 
variable = expression
 
array[index] = expression
 
Assigns an expression value to a variable or an
array variable at an index position. A formula
evaluates the expression on the right-hand
side of the statement. It places its result in the
variable you name on the left-hand side. The
left side of an assignment statement must
always be a local variable because a formula can
only change the value of local variables.
 
Within a "CHANGE_CONTEXTS" statement,
 assign values only to contexts. Outside a
"CHANGE_CONTEXTS" statement, assign
values only to input, output, and local variables.
 
RATE = HOURLY_RATE + 14
WAGE = HOURS_WORKED * RATE
CHANGE_CONTEXTS
 
(context1 = expression1 [,context2 =
expression2 ]
 
Changes one or more contexts within a formula.
Within the "CHANGE_CONTEXTS" statement,
 use ASSIGNMENT statements to assign the new
values.
 
CHANGE_CONTEXTS(AREA1 = TAX_
REPORTING_UNIT_INCOME_TAX_
JURISDICTION_GEOGRAPHY_ID)
(
 CHANGE_CONTEXTS(DEDUCTION_TYPE =
 'SBJ_TO_REGULAR_TAX')
 (
 L_TAXATION_METHOD = 'NONE'

 IF GET_OUTPUT('TR_EXISTS', 'N') =
 'Y' THEN
 L_TAXATION_METHOD = 'REGULAR_TAX'
 ) /* DEDUCTION_TYPE context change
 undone here. */
) /* AREA1 context change undone
 here. */
DEFAULT
 
DEFAULT FOR variable IS literal
 
DEFAULT_DATA_VALUE FOR variable IS literal
 
The DEFAUL T FOR statement provides a value
that the formula uses for a formula input or
database item in these situations:
 
â¢ The input wasn't assigned a value.
â¢ The database item's value couldn't be
retrieved from the database.
â¢ A non-array database item's value is
NULL.

Statement Statement Form Description and Example
The DEFAUL T_DATA_VALUE FOR statement
provides a value for an array database item
where individual data values are NULL.
 
Some database items are defined to require a
default value because they could return no data
or NULL values from the database.
 
DEFAULT FOR HOURLY_RATE IS 3.00
INPUTS ARE HOURLY_RATE
X = HOURS_WORKED * HOURLY_RATE
EXIT
 
EXIT
 
Immediately exits from the enclosing WHILE
loop. You can't use the EXIT statement outside
of a WHILE loop.
 
FOUND = -1 /* -1 is not a valid index
 for A. */
I = A.FIRST(-1)
WHILE (A.EXISTS(I)) LOOP

Grouping Statements
If you want to group more than one statement under IF/THEN statements, ELSE clauses, WHILE loops, or
CHANGE_CONTEXTS, enclose the group of statements within brackets. In the absence of brackets, the preceding
statement applies only to the first statement.
Here's an example of how you can group statements:
I = A.FIRST
WHILE (A.EXISTS(I)) LOOP
(
 A[I] = I
 I = A.NEXT(I,-1)
)
Here's an example of how you should not group statements::
I = A.FIRST
WHILE (A.EXISTS(I)) LOOP
 A[I] = I
 I = A.NEXT(I,-1) /* This is not executed as part of the loop. */

Naming Schemes for Variables  
You can use naming schemes for variables when adding them to formulas; however, you must avoid using reserved
words as variable names.
Naming Schemes
You can use one of these naming schemes:
â¢ Variable names comprise one or more words, joined by underscores. The words must each start with a letter
and can be followed by a combination of letters and digits.
â¢ Variable names begin and end with double quotes (''). Between the quotes, you can use any printable
characters, such as ''This is a quoted variable name''.
Note:  Any word consisting of only digits could be mistaken for numbers.
Formulas aren't case sensitive. For example, the variable named EMPLOYEE_NAME is the same as the variable
employee_name.
Tip:  The maximum length of a variable name is 255 characters.

Database Items  
Database items exist in the application database and have a computer code associated with them. The application uses
this code to find data. All database items are read-only variables.
You can't change database item values within a formula. If you try to write a value to a database item, you receive a
compilation error.
You can use database items in formulas and HCM extracts.
Database items are of these types:
â¢ Static
â¢ Dynamic
Static Database Items
Static database items are predefined. They include generic information about an employee, such as sex, birth date, and
work location. They also include data about other objects, such as the start and end dates of a payroll period.
Dynamic Database Items
The application creates dynamic database items when you create these objects. In the case of flexfields, you must run
the Generate Flexfield Database Items process to create the database items.
Object Description
Elements
 
The element name is the database item name prefix.
 
Defined Balances
 
The balance name followed by the balance dimension name is the database item name.
 
Formula global values
 
The global value name is the database item name.
 
Input values The element and input value names are the database item name prefix.

Object Description
  
Flexfields
 
The Generate Flexfield Database Items process creates database items for the contexts and segments
of your registered HCM flexfields.
 
Array Database Items
Array database items have an index type of NUMBER with indexes that start at 1 and increment by 1 without gaps. Here's
an example:
/* 1 is the starting index for an array database item. */
I = 1
WHILE DBI.EXISTS(I) LOOP
(
 V = DBI[I] /* Do some processing with element at index I. */
 I = I + 1 /* Array database items indexes go up in steps of 1. */
)
You can use the DEFAUL T_DATA_VALUE FOR statement to set a default value in scenarios where an array database
item returns a NULL value for an element. There can be only one DEFAUL T_DATA_VALUE FOR statement for each array
database item and it must appear at the start of the formula.
Here's an example of a DEFAUL T_DATA_VALUE FOR statement:
DEFAULT_DATA_VALUE FOR A IS 0
INPUTS ARE B, C
Here's an example of an array database item usage error:
 /* Array database item A. */
A[1] = 1
 A = B
A.DELETE(1)
A.DELETE

â¢ Overview of Generating Flexfield Database Items
Overview of Generating Flexfield Database Items  
You configure registered HCM flexfields to add contexts and segments for your business requirements.
After you deploy the flexfield, you can generate database items for the flexfield for use in your formulas and extracts
by submitting the Generate Flexfield Database Items process from the Payroll Checklist or Payroll Administration work
areas.
You can generate database items for the following flexfields:
â¢ Descriptive flexfields
â¢ Extensible flexfields for single and multiple row routes
â¢ Key flexfields
25
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 3
Fast Formula Components
The process generates database items at the enterprise level only. As a best practice, when you submit the process, skip
the legislative data group parameter so that the process generates database items for use by any legislative data group.
You can determine which database items to generate by specifying or skipping the flexfield and context parameters as
shown in the following table.
Flexfield Parameter Context Parameter Result
Specify parameter
 
Skip parameter
 
Generate database items for all the contexts
and related segments for a specified flexfield
 
Skip parameter
 
Skip parameter
 
Generate database items for all registered
flexfields and their contexts.
 
The process creates database item names with this following structure:
de<FLEXFIELD_CODE><CONTEXT_CODE><SEGMENT_CODE>
When you include the database item in a formula or extract, the application returns a value for the database item, based
on the flexfield context, for the segments column in the underlying flexfield table. After you generate database items,
compile any formulas using these database items.
Periodically, you may need to update a flexfield structure, for example to add a segment to capture additional data. If
you previously generated database items for a flexfield, submitting the process deletes and regenerates the associated
database items. After the process regenerates the database items, be sure to compile any formulas using them.

Formula Operators  
Formula operators are expressions that can contain arithmetic operators. These operators determine how the formula
manipulates variables and literals. For example, the plus operator (+) indicates that two items are added together. You
can also use operators to concatenate strings.
Types of Operators
Here's a list of the operator types:
Operator Description Example
+
 
Addition
 
A = B + 1
 
+
 
| |
 
String concatenation
 
A = 'Hello ' + 'World'
 
B = 'Hello ' || 'World'
 
-
 
Subtraction
 
A = B - 1
 
-
 
Unary minus
 
A = -B
 
28
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 3
Fast Formula Components
Operator Description Example
*
 
Multiplication
 
A = B * C
 
/
 
Division
 
A = B / C
 
Using Operators
You can use the arithmetic operators, subtraction, multiplication, and division only with numeric operands. You can
use the addition operator with numeric or text operands. The operands can be variables, literals, or sub-expressions. A
formula error occurs in these scenarios:
â¢ The second operand of a division equals zero
â¢ The result of multiplication is too large
Whether a number is too large or not is determined by the normal limits in the database. For string
concatenation, if the result is longer than 255 characters, a formula error occurs.
Expressions are evaluated in order from left to right. The unary minus has precedence over the other operators because
it applies directly to a single sub-expression. The multiplication and division operators take precedence over addition
and subtraction. For example, the expression 1 + 2 * 3 evaluates to 7 rather than 9. You can use brackets to change the
precedence of the operators. For example, (1 + 2) * 3 evaluates to 9.

Literals  
A literal is a piece of information that you manipulate or use in a formula.
Literals are of these types:
â¢ Numeric
â¢ Text
â¢ Date
â¢ Array
Numeric Literals
Follow these rules when entering numeric literals:
â¢ Don't use quotes to enclose the literal.
â¢ Don't use commas or spaces in the number.
â¢ Don't use exponents and floating point scientific notations.
â¢ You can enter numbers that have a decimal component after a decimal point.
29
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 3
Fast Formula Components
â¢ To enter a negative number, precede it with a minus sign (-).
Here are a few examples of numeric literals:
â¢ 63
â¢ 3.55
â¢ -2.3
â¢ -.033
â¢ -.2
â¢ 10000
Text Literals
When you enter text literals, enclose them in single quotes. Text literals can contain spaces. To enter a single quote
character in a text constant, enter two single quotes (for example, 'P O'Donnell'). Note that this isn't the same as the
double quotes ('').
Here are a few examples of text literals:
â¢ 'J. Smith'
â¢ '1234'
â¢ 'Manager'
â¢ '12 Union Road'
â¢ 'The Bonus this year is 23%'
Date Literals
When you enter a date literal, enclose dates in single quotes and follow immediately with the word date in brackets.
Here are a few examples of date literals:
â¢ '2010-11-04T00:00:00.000Z' (DATE)
â¢ '1989-03-12 00:00:00' (DATE)
â¢ '12-MAR-1989' (DATE)
Array Literals
An array holds multiple values that the formula can access using the corresponding index values. You define array
literals only for an empty array of each type.
Array literals are of these types:
â¢ Array of date values indexed by a numeric index (EMPTY_DATE_NUMBER)
â¢ Array of number values indexed by a numeric index (EMPTY_NUMBER_NUMBER)
â¢ Array of text values indexed by a numeric index (EMPTY_TEXT_NUMBER)
â¢ Array of date values indexed by a text index (EMPTY_DATE_TEXT)
â¢ Array of numeric values indexed by a text index (EMPTY_NUMBER_TEXT)
â¢ Array of text values indexed by a text index (EMPTY_TEXT_TEXT)

How Formulas Determine Variable Data Types  
Variables can be of these data types: numeric, text or date. The data type determines the type of information the
variable holds.
You don't have to specify the variable type. Formulas determine the type based on how you use the variable. For
example, if you set a variable to 'J. Smith', the formula interprets it as a text variable.
CAUTION:  Inconsistent or incorrect use of variables, such as trying to add a number to a text string, causes formula
compilation errors.
Determine Variable Data Types
Formulas process the rules that determine the variable data type in the order listed:
1. The variable can be an input you name in the input statement. For example:
INPUTS ARE SALARY_AMOUNT,
START_DATE (DATE),
FREQUENCY (TEXT)
If you don't specify the variable data type in the statement, the formula assumes it's a number.
You can use the DEFAUL T_FOR statement to determine the variable data type:
DEFAULT FOR B IS 0 /* B is a NUMBER variable. */
For an array database item, the DEFAUL T FOR statement determines the index type and value type:
DEFAULT FOR A IS EMPTY_NUMBER_NUMBER /* A is a NUMBER_NUMBER array variable. */
You can use the DEFAUL T_DATA_VALUE FOR statement to determine the variable data type:
DEFAULT_DATA_VALUE FOR A IS 0 /* A could be a NUMBER_NUMBER or NUMBER_TEXT variable. */
2. The formula searches the list of database items. If the variable is in the list, the data type is known.
3. If the variable appears in a context handling statement, then the formula searches the list of contexts. If the
variable is in the list, then the formula knows the data type, otherwise it returns an error.
4. If the variable isn't a database item or a context, then the formula treats it as a local variable and determines the
data type based on how you use the variable. For example:
A = 'abc' /* A is a TEXT variable. */

Array Variables  
You can use arrays for input, output, and local formula variables. These array variables can store date, number, or text
values. Arrays are similar to PL/SQL index-by tables.
Array Indexes
Here are some aspects of array indexes that you should be aware of:
â¢ The index types are either text or number.
â¢ Text indexes are upper case unique.
â¢ Gaps in index value sequences are permitted.
â¢ Number indexes are truncated to remove any fractional part.
â¢ You may iterate an array in an index either forwards or backward.
Array Data Types
You specify array types as DATA_TYPE_INDEX_TYPE. Arrays are of these data types:
â¢ NUMBER_NUMBER
â¢ NUMBER_TEXT
â¢ DATE_NUMBER
â¢ DATE_TEXT
â¢ TEXT_NUMBER
â¢ TEXT_TEXT
Rules for Using Arrays
Formula functions can't return arrays or take array parameters. Contexts can't be array types. If you try to reference an
array value at a nonexistent index, the application returns a formula execution error. However, you can delete an array
value at a nonexistent index.
Array Methods
Array methods enable you to get the first and last indexes, and to get the next or prior index. These methods return the
index data type. You can specify a default value for these methods, if the required indexes don't exist. You can use array
methods to determine whether an index exists or not.
Note:  The array method syntax doesn't work directly with the array literal values. For example, you can't use a
construct such as EMPTY_DATE_NUMBER.COUNT.
Here's a list of the array methods, including their descriptions and usage examples:
32
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 3
Fast Formula Components
Array Method Description Usage Example
<name> [ <index value> ]
 
Get the value for an index.
 
V = A[1]
 
<name> . FIRST( <default value> )
 
Get the first index for an array. The default
value is returned if the array is empty.
 
I = A.FIRST(-1)
 
<name> . LAST( <default value> )
 
Get the last index for an array.
 
L = B.LAST(' ')
 
<name> . EXISTS( <index value> )
 
Conditional checking if a value exists at an
index. The default value is returned if the array
is empty.
 
IF A.EXISTS(1) THEN
 
<name> . NEXT( <index value> , <default index
value> )
 
Get the next index given an index position.
The default value is returned if there is no next
index.
 
N = A.NEXT(1)
 
<name> . PRIOR( <index value> , <default index
value> )
 
Get the prior index given the index position.
The default value is returned if there is no prior
index.
 
P = B.PRIOR('Two')
 
<name> , COUNT
 
Numeric method to count the array elements.
 
C = A.COUNT
 
<name , DELETE( <index value> )
 
Delete the element at an index position.
 
B.DELETE('three')
 
<name> , DELETE()
 
Delete all elements.
 
B.DELETE()
 
Iterating Through an Array
In this example, A is an array variable with a NUMBER index. -1234 is known to be an invalid index for A, so it's used as a
default value when the FIRST and NEXT calls can't find an index.
/* -1234 is not a valid index for A in this instance, so use as default. */
NI = A.FIRST(-1234)
WHILE A.EXISTS(NI) LOOP
(
 VA = A[NI] /* Do some processing with element at index NI. */
 NI = A.NEXT(NI,-1234) /* Go to next index. */
)
In this example, B is an array variable with a TEXT index. -1234 is known to be an invalid index for B, so it's used as a
default value when the FIRST and NEXT calls can't find an index.
/* 'No Index' is not a valid index for A in this instance, so use as default. */
TI = B.FIRST('No Index')
WHILE B.EXISTS(TI) LOOP
(
 VB = B[TI] /* Do some processing with element at index TI. */
 TI = B.NEXT(TI, 'No Index') /* Go to next index. */
)
The following example iterates backwards from through an array C with a NUMBER inde.
/* -1234 is not a valid index for C in this instance, so use as default. */
NI = C.LAST(-1234)

â¢ Overview of Using Fast Formula Components
Formula Contexts  
Formulas run within an application-specific execution context, which determines the context variables available to the
formula. Context values act as SQL bind values when the formula fetches database item values from the database.
Formulas can also pass context values into formula function calls.
Here are some examples of the execution contexts:
â¢ EFFECTIVE_DATE : The date on which the formula becomes effective.
â¢ PAYROLL_ID: The payroll run for which the formula is processed.
â¢ PERSON_ID: The person for whom the formula is processed.
Context Value Setting
The application code that's calling a formula usually sets all the context values. For some complex applications, such as
the payroll run, the code sets only the contexts necessary to meet general processing requirements.
Here's how formulas for payroll work:
â¢ A payroll run sets contexts for the legislative data group, date earned, the payroll being processed, the payroll
relationship, payroll actions, and the person being processed.
â¢ Additional, country-specific contexts are also available. For example, the jurisdiction area and tax code context
values are country-specific.
Formula Context-Handling Statements
If you use a variable in a context-handling statement, the formula searches the list of contexts. The variable must
appear in the contexts list; otherwise the formula returns an error. The data type is stored along with the context list
entry.
This table describes the formula context-handling statements.
Statement Purpose of the Statement Example
CHANGE_CONTEXTS(assignment [,...])
 
Changes context values within the context
changing block. Inside this block, the formula
function calls, the database items, and the
called formulas use the new context values.
Outside the block, the formula uses the original
values.
 
/*
 * Nested Context changes: DBI1
 depends upon SOURCE_ID and SOURCE_
TEXT. */
CHANGE_CONTEXTS(SOURCE_TEXT = 'A')
(
 /* SOURCE_TEXT = 'A' */

Statement Purpose of the Statement Example
You can nest context changing blocks to apply
context changes in stages.
 
 X = DBI1
 
 /* Nesting used to change Contexts

 CHANGE_CONTEXT(SOURCE_ID = 2)
 (
 /* SOURCE_TEXT = 'A',
SOURCE_ID = 2 */
 Y = DBI1
 
 /* Overriding a Context change. */
 CHANGE_CONTEXTS(SOURCE_TEXT = 'B',
SOURCE_ID = 3)
 (
 /* SOURCE_TEXT = 'B', SOURCE_ID = 3
 */
 Z = DBI1
 )
)
CONTEXT_IS_SET(context)
 
Tests whether or not a context value is set.
 
This code tests whether or not the AREA3
context is set.
 
IF CONTEXT_IS_SET(AREA3) THEN
GET_CONTEXT(context, default value)
 
Returns a context's value if the context is set,
 otherwise it returns the default value specified
in its second argument.
 
/* AREA1 is a context of type TEXT.
 */
AREA1_VALUE = GET_CONTEXT(AREA1,' ')
Overview of Working Storage Area  
The working storage area is a mechanism for storing global values across formulas.
Using the different call methods, you can test whether or not an item exists in the storage area, delete an item, set the
value for an item, and get a value for an item. You can access the values by name. The names are case-independent.
This table lists the working storage area methods.
Method Description
WSA_EXISTS(item [, type])
 
Tests whether or not the item called item exists in the storage area. If type is specified, then the item
must be of the same type. These are the valid values for type:
 
â¢ DATE
â¢ DATE_NUMBER
â¢ DATE_TEXT
â¢ NUMBER
â¢ NUMBER_NUMBER
â¢ NUMBER_TEXT
35
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources

Method Description
â¢ TEXT
â¢ TEXT_NUMBER,
â¢ TEXT_TEXT
WSA_DELETE([item])
 
Deletes the item called item. If you don't specify a name, then all the storage area data is deleted.
 
WSA_SET(item, value)
 
Sets the value for the item called item. Any existing item of the same name is overwritten.
 
WSA_GET(item, default-value)
 
Retrieves a value for the item called item. If there is no item called item, then the method returns the
default value. The data type of default-value is the expected data type for item.
 
Overview of Calling a Formula from a Formula  
A formula can call another formula. This enables some modularity in formula organization. You specify the called
formula name and any formula input or output names as TEXT values. The names are case-independent.
You can call a formula in any of these ways:
â¢ Using a single call
â¢ Using separate calls
As you write your formula, consider these points:
â¢ Validation of the Called Formula
â¢ Passing Contexts
â¢ Call a Formula using any of these methods:
â¦ Using Separate Calls
â¦ Using a Single Self-Contained Call
â¢ Use Cases to Compare Methods
Validation of the Called Formula
When a formula runs, it validates whether the called formula can be run, and whether the specified input and output
data types are correct. You can use the IS_EXECUTABLE call to determine whether an executable formula with a specified
name exists. You must compile the formula to make it available for the specified legislative data group. Also, the formula
must be valid on the effective date on which the calling formula runs. In addition, the payroll code imposes extra
restrictions based on formula type combinations.
Passing Contexts
Context values are inherited from the calling formula. You can also set or unset the context values explicitly in the
nested formula call.
36
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 3
Fast Formula Components
Alternative Methods to Call a Formula
You can call a formula fro within another formula in any of these ways:
â¢ Using a series of separate calls
â¢ Using a single self-contained call
Using Separate Calls
You can use three separate calls:
1. Set the Inputs
Use the SET_INPUT call for each formula input and context that you need to explicitly set for the formula call. You
don't need to specify all formula inputs and contexts. To explicitly unset a context value, use the SET_INPUT call
without passing the optional value parameter. Any extra inputs specified in SET_INPUT calls are ignored.
2. Call the Formula
Use the EXECUTE call to call a formula.
3. Get the Formula Outputs
Use one or more GET_OUTPUT calls to fetch outputs from the last formula call.
When the formula runs, it returns an execution error in these scenarios:
â¢ The called formula isn't executable.
â¢ The called formula is already running.
â¢ The data type of an input variable (specified using SET_INPUT) or an output variable (specified using
GET_OUTPUT) doesn't match its actual data type within the called formula.
This table summarizes the methods for calling a formula using separate calls.
Method Use To
SET_INPUT(input [,value])
 
Sets the value of an input or a context to the value specified in the value parameter. The value
parameter is optional. If you specify the value parameter, the input is set to this value. If you don't
specify the value parameter, the input or context is passed as unset to the formula. The data type of
the value is the expected data type for the input.
 
If you use a context in a SET_INPUT call, its value will be set to the value in the calling formula.
 
EXECUTE(formula)
 
Executes the called formula.
 
GET_OUTPUT(output, default-
value)
 
Gets the value of the output parameter after calling a formula. If there is no formula output called
'output' or it's not set, the formula returns the value specified in the default value parameter. The data
type of default value is the expected data type for the output.
 
Note:  Formula inputs that are set using SET_INPUT persist as long as no EXECUTE or GET_OUTPUT calls are made. Output
values from a called formula persist as long as no SET_INPUT or new EXECUTE calls are made. When the calling formula
exits, the process removes any saved input or output values.

Using a Single Self-Contained Call
Here's what a single self-contained call does:
â¢ Clears the input values at the start to not use prior SET_INPUT call values.
â¢ Discards the outputs at the end so that the subsequent GET_OUTPUT calls only return the default values.
Here's how you can use the CALL_FORMULA method:
CALL_FORMULA(formula, [set statement, get statement])
A SET statement is a SET_INPUT call. A GET statement assigns the result of a GET_OUTPUT call to a variable in the calling
formula. The calls execute in this order:
1. SET_INPUT calls
2. EXECUTE call
3. GET_OUTPUT assignments
The compiler generates code to execute in this order, even if SET and GET statements are interspersed.

Examples of Calling a Formula from a Formula  
Use these examples to understand how to call a formula from another formula using these methods:
â¢ A series of separate calls
â¢ A single self-contained call
The examples include two versions of a wage formula, and a table comparing the two methods using a few use cases.
The first two examples show different versions of the wage formula. These points apply to both examples:
â¢ The formula calls RATE_FORMULA to get a value for HOURL Y_RATE.
â¢ The RATE_FORMULA enters text to call UNIT.
â¢ The formula call sets to enter the UNIT to 'Hourly'.
â¢ The RATE_FORMULA returns the rate in the output variable called RATE.
â¢ The GET_OUTPUT call returns 0.00 if the RATE_FORMULA doesn't return RATE.
Wage Formula Using Separate Calls
This example shows how to call a formula using separate calls.
SET_INPUT('UNIT', 'Hourly')
EXECUTE('RATE_FORMULA')
HOURLY_RATE = GET_OUTPUT('RATE',0.0)
WAGE = HOURS_WORKED * HOURLY_RATE
RETURN WAGE

Sample Expressions to Compare Methods
Here's what you can do using sample expressions in the two methods:
â¢ Call a formula
â¢ Set inputs and context values
â¢ Unset context values
â¢ Get output values into a variable or array variable
â¢ Provide a default output value
Note:  SET_INPUT or > statements have no effect if the calling formula has no formula input or context of the same
name.
This table shows a few use cases that compare the two methods using sample expressions.
Use Case Using Separate Calls Using a Self-Contained Call
Execute a formula where the formula GET_
RATES is executed
 
EXECUTE('GET_RATES') Use within a CALL_FORMULA statement
 
'GET_RATES'
Set an input value in the called formula where
you round off EXTRA_HOURS to 2 decimal
places and set the input OVERTIME in the called
formula.
 
SET_INPUT
('OVERTIME'
,ROUNDUP(EXTRA_HOURS,2)
)
Use within a CALL_FORMULA statement
 
ROUNDUP(EXTRA_HOURS,2) >'OVERTIME'
Leave a formula input value unset inside the
called formula, where RATE isn't a formula
context.
 
A SET_INPUTS statement isn't required, but you
can this:
 
SET_INPUT('RATE')
A SET statement isn't required, but you can use
this:

Inherit a context value from the called formula.
 
For example, both the calling formula and the
called formula support the AREA1 context. The
called formula inherits the AREA1 context value
from the calling formula.

4  Fast Formula Functions
Overview of Fast Formula Functions  
Fast formula functions manipulate data in different ways and always return a value. Functions are of these data types:
date, number, text,and array (date_number, number_number, text_number, date_text, number_text, and text_text).
Function operands are of these data types: date, number, and text. A fast formula function is identified by its name,
return data type, data types, and usage behavior.
Here's how the general form of a fast formula function looks like:
NAME-OF-FUNCTION(operand,operand,...)
Operands can be optional or mandatory. You can use operands any number of times in a statement; for example,
with the GREATEST function. The formula compiler resolves functions by matching function calls against function
specifications. You can use multiple functions with the same name within a fast formula, provided that they have
different return or data types.
Some fast formula functions return values that are useful in specific formula types, such as absence management,
benefits, or compensation. The more generic functions fall into these categories:
Category Purpose of Functions
Text
 
Manipulate text data
 
Number
 
Manipulate numeric data
 
Date
 
Manipulate dates
 
Data Conversion
 
Convert data to a different data type
 
Message Handling
 
Return messages
 
Text Formula Functions  
Here are the formula functions that you can use to manipulate text data:
CHR(n)
Returns the character having the binary equivalent to a number operand n in the ASCII character set.
41
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 4
Fast Formula Functions
GREATEST(expr, expr [,expr]....)
Compares the values of all the text string operands. It returns the value of the last string in alphabetic order.
INITCAP(expr)
Returns the expression expr with the first letter of each word in uppercase. Delimits the words or characters that aren't
alphanumeric by a white space.
INSTR(expr1, expr2 [,n [,m]])
Searches expr1 beginning with its nth character for the mth occurrence of expr2 and returns the character position in
expr1 for the first character of this occurrence. If n is negative, INSTR counts and searches backward from the end of
expr1. The value of m must be positive. The default values of both n and m are 1, meaning INSTR begins searching at the
first character of expr1 for the first occurrence of expr2. The return value is relative to the beginning of expr1, regardless
of the value of n, and is expressed in characters. If the search is unsuccessful (expr1 doesn't appear m times after the nth
character of expr1), the return value is 0.
INSTRB(expr1, expr2 [,n [,m]])
Works in the same way as INSTR, except that n and the return values are expressed in bytes, rather than in characters.
For a single-byte character set, INSTRB is equivalent to INSTR.
LEAST(expr, expr [,expr]...)
Compares the values of all the text string operands. Returns the first string in alphabetic order from among its
operands.
LENGTH(expr)
Returns the number of characters in the text string operand expr.
LENGTHB(expr)
Returns the length of expr in units of bytes.
LOWER(expr)
Converts a text string to lowercase.
LPAD(expr, n [,pad])
Returns the text string operand expr left-padded to length n with the sequence of characters in pad. The default value
for pad is a blank. If expr is longer than n, then LPAD returns the portion of expr that fits in n.
These are a few examples of this expression:
/* A is set to 'XYXYXhello' */
A = LPAD ('hello, 10, 'XY')
/* A is set to 'hell' */
A = LPAD ('hello', 4 )
42
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 4
Fast Formula Functions
L TRIM(expr [,set])
Returns the text string operand expr with all the left-most characters that appear in set removed. The default for set is a
blank. If none of the left-most characters of expr appear in set, then LTRIM returns expr.
Examples:
/* A is set to 'def' */
A = LTRIM ('abcdef','abc')
/* A is set to 'abcdef' *
/A = LTRIM ('abcdef','bc')
REPLACE(expr, search [,replacement])
Returns the text string operand expr with every occurrence of search replaced with replacement. If you omit replacement,
it removes all occurrences of search. Use REPLACE to substitute one string for another or to remove character strings.
Example:
/* Set A to 'BLACK and BLUE'. */
A = REPLACE('JACK and JUE', 'J', BL')
RPAD(expr, n [,pad])
Returns the text string operand expr right-padded to length n with the sequence of characters in pad. The default value
for pad is a blank. If expr is longer than n, then RPAD returns the portion of expr that fits in n.
Examples:
/* A is set to 'helloXYXYX' */
A = RPAD ('hello, 10, 'XY')
/* A is set to 'hell' */
A = RPAD ('hello', 4 )
RTRIM(expr [,set])
Returns the text string operand expr with all the right-most characters that appear in set removed. The default value for
set is a blank. If none of the right-most characters of expr appear in set, then expr is returned.
Examples:
/* A is set to 'abc' */
A = RTRIM ('abcdef','def')
/* A is set to 'abcdef' */
A = RTRIM ('abcdef','de')
SUBSTR(expr, m [,n]) or SUBSTRING(expr, m [,n])
SUBSTRING returns a sub string of the text string operand expr of length n characters beginning at the mth character. If n is
negative, SUBSTR counts backward of expr. If you omit the n, the sub string starts from m and finishes at the end of expr.
Example:
/* Check that the tax code starts with GG */
IF length(Tax_code) <= 2 
THEN
(message = 'Tax code is too short'
RETURN message
)IF substr( Tax_code, 1, 2) = 'GG' THEN ...
43
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 4
Fast Formula Functions
SUBSTRB((expr, m [,n])
The same as SUBSTR, except that the arguments m and n are expressed in bytes, rather than in characters. For a single-
byte database character set, SUBSTRB is equivalent to SUBSTR.
TRANSLATE(expr,from,to)
Returns the text string operand expr with all occurrences of each character in from replaced by its corresponding
character in to. Characters in expr that aren't in from aren't replaced. The argument from can contain more characters
than to. In this case, the extra characters at the end of from have no corresponding characters in to. If these extra
characters appear in expr, they're removed from the return value.
TRIM(expr)
Trims leading and trailing spaces from a character string.
UPPER(expr)
Converts a text string to uppercase.
SPLIT FUNCTIONS
These Text Formula Functions return TEXT_NUMBER arrays. The arrays contain the result of splitting the string by a
separator.
SPLIT_BY_SPACES
The separator is a sequence of one or more consecutive spaces. Here "space" includes tab character, newline in addition
to space ' '.
SPLIT_BY_SPACES(expr)
Here's an example of SPLIT_BY_SPACES:
SPLIT_BY_SPACES(' Hello World !! ')
The return value is an array containing 'Hello', 'World', '!!' in that order.
SPLIT
SPLIT(expr, separator, default_string)
Splits expr into strings, separated by separator, and returns the strings in a TEXT_NUMBER array. If there is nothing
between two consecutive separators then default_string is returned in the array.
SPLIT Example 1:
SPLIT('Hello|World', '|', '_')
The return value is an array containing 'Hello', 'World' in that order.
SPLIT Example 2 Multiple Character Separator:
SPLIT('Hello||World', '||', '_')
The return value is an array containing 'Hello', 'World' in that order.
44
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 4
Fast Formula Functions
SPLIT Example 3 Showing default string use:
SPLIT('|Hello||World|', '|', '_')
The return value is an array containing '_', 'Hello', '_', 'World', '_' in that order. The default string, '_', replaces "gaps"
between separators i.e. before first '|', after second '|' and before 3rd '|', and after last '|'.
SPLIT Example 4 Input String Without Separator:
SPLIT('Hello', '||', '_')
The return value is an array just containing 'Hello'.
Numeric Formula Functions  
Here are the formula functions that you can use to manipulate numeric data:
ABS(n)
Returns the magnitude of a numeric operand n as a positive numeric value. If the value of the operand is positive, its
value returns unchanged. If the operand is negative, then the value's sign inverts and the value returns as a positive
number.
Example:
ABS (-17)
It returns 17.
FLOOR(n)
Returns the integer part of a numeric operand n. If the value of the operand contains information after the decimal
point, FLOOR discards that information and returns a whole number.
Example:
FLOOR(35.455)
It returns 35.
GREATEST(n, n [, n] ...) or GREATEST_OF(n, n [, n] ...)
Compares all the operands and returns the greatest value.
LEAST(n, n [, n] ...) or LEAST_OF(n, n [, n] ...)
Compares all the operands and returns the smallest value.
MOD(m, n)
Returns the remainder after dividing m by n.
45

Chapter 4
Fast Formula Functions
POWER(m, n)
Returns m raised to the nth power.
ROUND(m [,n])
Rounds m to n decimal places. The default number of decimal places is 0.
Examples:
ROUND(2.3401, 2)
It returns 2.34.
ROUND (2.3461, 2)
It returns 2.35.
ROUNDUP(m [,n]) or ROUND_UP(m [,n])
Rounds off m up to n decimal places. The default number of places is 0.
Examples:
ROUND_UP(2.3401, 2)
It returns 2.35.
ROUND_UP(2.3400, 2)
It returns 2.34.
TRUNC(n [,m]) or TRUNCATE(n [,m])
Truncates m down to n decimal places. The default number of places is 0.
Examples:
TRUNC(2.3401, 2)
It returns 2.34.
Date Formula Functions  
Here are the formula functions that you can use to manipulate date data:
ADD_DAYS(date, n)
Adds n whole days to date.
Example:
ADD_DAYS ('30-DEC-1990' (date), 6)
46
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources

It returns 5 JAN 1991.
ADD_MONTHS(date, n)
Adds n whole months to date.
ADD_YEARS(date, n)
Adds n whole years to date.
DAYS_BETWEEN(date1, date2)
Returns the number of days between date1 and date2. If date1 is later than date2, then the result is a positive number. If
date1 is earlier than date2, then the result is a negative number.
Here's an example of this function:
DAYS_BETWEEN('1995/06/27 00:00:00' (date), '1995/07/03 00:00:00' (date))
It returns - 6.
Similarly;
DAYS_BETWEEN('2016/12/31 00:00:00'(DATE), '2017/01/01 00:00:00'(DATE)) 
It return -1.
GET_SYSDATE()
Returns the current system date value according to an internal notion of system date.
LAST_DAY(date)
Returns the last day of the month containing date.
LEAST(date, date [, date] ...)
Compares the operands and returns the earliest date.
MONTHS_BETWEEN(date1, date2)
Returns the number of months between date1 and date2. If date1 is later than date2, the result is a positive number. If
date1 is earlier than date2, the result is a negative number. The return value has a numeric data type that can contain a
fraction if the dates don't differ by a whole number of months.
NEW_TIME(date, zone1, zone2)
Returns the date and time in zone2 when the date and time in zone1 are date.
Here are the standard text strings that you can store in arguments zone1 and zone2:

function.
TO_CHAR(n) and TO_TEXT(n)
Converts the number n to a character string in canonical number format.
TO_DATE (expr [, format])
Converts the character string expr to a date in the specified format. If no format is specified, then expr must be in
canonical format.
TO_NUMBER(expr) and TO_NUM(expr)

5  Formulas for Payroll
Overview of Payroll Formulas  
Here are the tasks you can do using payroll formulas in your application:
â¢ Prorate payroll results
â¢ Convert rate periodicities
â¢ Validate element entry values
â¢ Control preferences for payment methods
â¢ Use HR database items in formulas
â¢ Set default organization payment methods
â¢ Return salary amounts

You can copy and edit the predefined formulas or create your own.
This table describes the types of formulas that you can use within your payroll application.
Formula or Type Description Example
Proration Formula
 
Controls how the payroll calculation prorates
an element entry. Proration occurs when the
formula encounters an event, such as a change
to an element entry value.
 
Return a proration factor or .25 for absences
based on an employee type, such as a system
analyst on temporary assignment.
 
Rate Conversion Formula
 
Creates a formula to convert rates for proration
when you require different values for periodicity
than the ones used in the predefined formulas.
 
Specify a different number of working hours to
use when converting annual values into hourly
rates, such as 2080 annual hours.
 
Element Input Validation Formula Type
 
Here's what you can do with this formula:
 
â¢ Validate element entry values
â¢ Provide a default value for an element
entry value
â¢ Calculate entry values based on other
entry values
Multiply the pay rate by 1.5 if the employee
works more than 40 hours a week. Use this
formula at the element or element eligibility
level.
 
User T able Validation Formula Type
 
Validates entries in user-defined tables.
 
Return an error message if a user enters a value
less than 10 or greater than 50 in the Dues
column of the Union Dues user table.

Creates a scheduling formula when the
scheduling options for submitting a process,
 report, or flow don't cover your requirements.
You can also determine how often the formula
submits future instances of the flow.
 
Load time card batches daily. Or, write a
formula to increase the number of batch loads
at the end of a payroll period when workers
typically submit their time cards.
 
Payroll User Interface Configuration Formula
Type
 
Create formulas to control preferences for
payment methods for the enterprise if you
don't want to use the default configuration.
After you create your formulas, you attach
them to the appropriate rows in the Payroll User
Interface Configuration user-defined table.
 
Set the default organization payment method
for each legislative data group.
 
Payroll Access to HR Formula Type
 
Calls a payroll formula when your payroll
formula requires an HR database item.
 
Return salary amounts and then use the Payroll
Access to HR formula to return a full-time
equivalent (FTE) database item for a specific
group of employees.
 
Payroll Relationship Group Formula Type
 
Returns Yes or No values to indicate whether a
person is part of a payroll relationship group.
 
Restrict the payroll run process to a specific set
of employees, based on assignment and person
level attributes.
 
Flow Schedule Formula Type
 
Controls when the application submits the
current flow and how often it submits future
instances of the flow.
 
Create a formula that schedules the frequency
with which an extract process checks for new
starter details.
 
Balance Exception Formula Type
 
Creates formulas to return reference values for
comparison in balance exception reports.
 
Multiply the year-to-date gross earnings by 5
percent and return the value when the balance
exception report to which it's associated is run.
 
Element Skip Formula Type
 
Uses conditional processing to define when the
run should process the element, and when it
should skip it. If you specify a skip rule for the
element, payroll runs process the element only
when the conditions of the formula are met.
Otherwise, it skips the element. You select skip
rules on the Manage Elements page.
 
Specify to process the Union Fees element in
every run, unless the Union_Fees_Paid balance
is greater than 10,000.
 
Create Conversion Formulas for Proration  
The predefined proration formula GLB_EARN_PRORATION controls how the payroll calculation prorates an element
entry when it encounters an event. This could happen when there's a change to an element entry value.
You can copy and edit a predefined proration formula to modify the calculation. Then, you can select the user-defined
formula as the proration formula for your element.

Create a Formula
You must create a modified rate conversion before you create its related proration conversion rule.
1. Select the formula type Payroll Run Proration.
2. Search for and copy the predefined Rate Conversion Proration formula.
3. Add the suffix underscore _PRORATE to the name.
4. Update these formula inputs:
â¦ PRORATE_START_DATE (date)
â¦ PRORATE_END_DATE (date)
â¦ SOURCE_PERIODICITY (text)
â¦ DAYS_WORKED (number)
â¦ RATE_CONV_FORMULA (text)
â¦ HOURS_WORKED (number)
â¦ IN_AMOUNT (number)
â¦ UNIT_TYPE (text)
â¦ PRORATION_UNIT (text)
5. Add the formula outputs for the element input values.
6. Save, submit, and compile the formula.
Some countries or territories supply predefined proration formulas that you can use as the basis for your modified
version.

â¢ Periodicity Conversion
Configure Periodicity Conversion Rules  
You can use the predefined periodicity conversion formulas when converting rates for hours multiplied by rate
calculations of an element run result. You can also use these formulas for rates based on rate definitions and proration
unless you specify another proration formula.
The conversion rule applies to the Flat Amount, Hours * Rate, and Days * Rate calculation rules.
Here's what you can do to use a different value instead of the predefined value for periodicity:
â¢ Override the default periodicity for the element definition at the element entry level.
â¢ Create your own periodicity conversion formula.
For example, you can create a formula to specify a different number of working hours when converting annual values
into hourly rates.

Note:  As a best practice, if you configure a periodicity rate formula, you should also create a related proration
formula.
Configure a Formula
Complete these steps to configure a rate conversion formula:
1. On the Home page, click the Fast Formulas task under the My Client Groups tab to search for formulas with
the Rate Conversion formula type.
2. Search for and display the rate conversion formula you want to copy.
3. Create a new formula with the formula type Rate Conversion.
4. Copy the formula text into your new formula.
5. Edit the periodicity values.
For example, if you create a rate conversion formula that uses 7.5 hours instead of 8 hours for the number of
work hours in a day, you would edit the periodicity as follows:
else if (out_periodicity = 'WORKHOUR') then
 l_amt = (l_year_amt /260)/ 7.5
6. Save, submit, and compile the formula.
7. Use the Elements task to search for the element and identify the formula used to calculate the element.
8. Use the Fast Formulas task to edit the formula.
Edit the rate converter call, replacing the rate conversion formula name with the name of your new formula.
 CALL_FORMULA( 'RATE_CONVERTER',
 l_rate > 'SOURCE_AMOUNT',
 l_source_periodicity > 'SOURCE_PERIODICITY',
 l_target_periodicity > 'TARGET_PERIODICITY',
 'ANNUALIZED RATE CONVERSION' > 'method', 
/* replace with the name of new formula*/
 l_actual_amount < 'TARGET_AMOUNT' DEFAULT 0) 
9. Save, submit, and recompile the formula.

sets the maximum number of allowed personal payment methods.
The Payroll User Interface Configuration formula type doesnât support database items. As with other formula types, to
retrieve information when a database item isn't available, use the GET_VALUE_SET function.
Note:  When using the GET_VALUE_SET function, ensure that the Value Attributes Table Alias field for the value set
has no value. The function fails if you provide an alias.

Payroll Relationship Group Formula Type  
The Payroll Relationship Group formula type returns Yes or No to indicate whether a person is part of a payroll
relationship group. The formula contains the criteria that define the group.
You can use these groups to define a set of people for payroll processing, data entry, or reporting. On the Object Groups
page, select the formula when creating a payroll relationship group.
For example, you can use the Payroll Relationship Group formula type to restrict the payroll run process to a specific set
of employees based on assignment and person-level attributes.
By default, you create formulas of this type using the Expression editor on the Create Fast Formula page. However, you
can use the text editor to create more complex formulas, if required.
These contexts are available to all formulas of this type:
â¢ PAYROLL_RELATIONSHIP_ID
â¢ PAYROLL_TERM_ID
â¢ DATE_EARNED
â¢ OBJECT_GROUP_ID
â¢ EFFECTIVE_DATE
â¢ PAYROLL_ASSIGNMENT_ID
â¢ PAYROLL_ID
â¢ LEGISLATIVE_DATA_GROUP_ID
You must have at least one input value called LEVEL_NAME. The data type is text and these are the valid values:
â¢ PAY_REL
â¢ PAY_TERM
â¢ PAY_ASG
This return value is available to the INCLUDE_FLAG formula type. The data type is text.

Flow Schedule Formula Type  
Use Flow Schedule formulas to control when to submit the current flow and how often to submit future instances of the
flow. You create scheduling formulas on the Manage Fast Formulas page when the predefined formulas don't meet your
requirements.
Letâs say you create a formula that loads time card batches daily, and increases to four times a day at the end of a payroll
period when workers typically submit their time cards. You can create a formula that schedules the frequency with which
an extract process checks for new starter details.
Here are a few points to consider when creating or updating a scheduling formula:
â¢ Specify a meaningful name to assist the person selecting the formula.
â¢ Review the formula to ensure it doesn't contain negative numbers that might produce an error condition, such
as running a process continually.
â¢ After updating the formula, cancel any scheduled flows that use the formula. Resubmit the flow to apply the
updated definition.
The SCHEDULED_DATE (scheduled date) context is available to formula of this type.
Hereâs the list of database items that are available to Flow Schedule formulas.

Element Skip Formula Type  
If your payroll policies require conditional processing of an element, you can write a formula to define when the run
should process the element, and when it should skip it.
For example, your formula can specify to process the Union Fees element in every run, unless the Union_Fees_Paid
balance is greater than 10,000.
72
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 5
Formulas for Payroll
Your skip rule formula must be consistent with other processing rules defined for the element, such as frequency rules,
which determine in which period the element is normally processed. A skip rule cannot contravene any other processing
rules in place for the element. You can associate only one element skip rule formula with each element. You must write
and validate the formula before you define the element, so that you can select the formula from a list on the Element
window.
Here's how you can write a formula defining a skip rule:
1. Select the Element Skip formula type in the Formulas window.
The formula must set and return a local variable of type text, and named as skip_flag.
The following example of a skip rule formula defines that the Union Fees element isn't processed if the
Union_Fees balance is greater than or equal to 10,000:
DEFAULT FOR UNION_FEES_REL_NOCB_YTD IS 0
 
l_amount = 0
l_amount = UNION_FEES_REL_NOCB_YTD
 
SKIP_FLAG = 'N'
 IF l_amount >= 10000 THEN
 (
 SKIP_FLAG = 'Y'
 )
 RETURN SKIP_FLAG
2. Associate this formula to the element in the Skip Formula field.

Options to Define Qualification Plans  
Configure the following rules when you create an absence qualification plan in accordance with the leave policy of your
enterprise:
â¢ Plan term
â¢ Plan eligibility
â¢ Enrollment and termination
â¢ Payments
Plan Term
A qualification plan term is an assessment period for which the Evaluate Absence process calculates entitlements for the
total absent time recorded in that period. When you create an absence qualification plan, you must select the type of
plan term. For example, you can limit the duration of the plan term to the duration of the absence.
Plan Eligibility
Associate an eligibility profile with the qualification plan to determine the set of workers who are eligible to record an
absence that belongs to that plan.
Enrollment and Termination
Decide when to enroll workers in the qualification plan. Also, decide whether ongoing payments under this plan must
continue if a worker is terminated or loses eligibility for the plan.
Payments
Use an entitlement band matrix to determine the payment percentages that apply for specific time periods during an
absence. Decide how you want to calculate the payment rate of a single unit of absence. You can use a rate definition to
include the calculation rules, or use a formula. For example, you want workers who have completed a particular tenure
to receive specific percentage of pay for a specific absence period.
The following table shows a sample scenario:
Length of Service Payment Rule
5 to 10 years
 
75 percent up to 10 absent days.
 
10 to 20 years
 
75 percent up to 20 absent days.
 
Decide how you want to calculate the payment rate of a single unit of absence. You can use a rate definition to include
the calculation rules, or use a formula.

Options to Define Accrual Plans  
Configure the following rules when you create an absence accrual plan in accordance with the leave policy of your
enterprise:
â¢ Plan term
â¢ Plan eligibility
â¢ Enrollment and termination
â¢ Transfer and rollover
â¢ Prior balance reinstatement
â¢ Vesting period
â¢ Plan limits
â¢ Balance Updates
â¢ Payments
â¢ Disbursement
â¢ Donation
Plan Term
An accrual term is a period of time during which workers accrue time. You must specify the type of accrual term to use
for the plan. For example, you can define one of these term types:
â¢ An accrual term of one calendar year that restarts on January 1
â¢ An accrual term that starts on the worker's annual hire date and restarts on every anniversary
Plan Eligibility
Associate an eligibility profile with the accrual plan to determine the set of workers who can enroll in that plan.
Enrollment and Termination
Decide when to enroll workers in the accrual plan. Indicate how to handle negative and positive balances where only
plan enrollment ends, or both plan enrollment and employment ends.
Transfer, Rollover, and Carryover
Define the limits for transfer of some or all of the accrual balance to a new plan when the existing plan is terminated
due to loss of eligibility. The Transfer Rules section is enabled only when you select Transfer positive balance in the
Balance Disposition section.
76
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 6
Formulas for Absence Management
Additionally, for year end processing, you can define:
â¢ Rollover limits so that employees can transfer remaining balance to a new plan. Select Unlimited if you don't
want to define a limit for rollover.
â¢ Carryover limits to determine the maximum unused leave time that employees can take over to the next term
for the same plan.
If the unused absence balance at the end of the term is above the defined rollover and carryover limit, you can choose
to pay out the remaining balance. If you don't select the Disburse remaining balance check box, the unused accrual
balance expires.
Note:  During the year end processing, the application first processes the rollover, and only then processes the
carryover with the leftover balance.
Prior Balance Reinstatement
Configure accrual plans so that when a worker is terminated or loses plan eligibility, the remaining balance can be
optionally held for reinstatement upon rehire or return to plan eligibility.
Absence plan setup options allow you to define the balance amount eligible for reinstatement along with the time frame
for which the withheld balance can be reinstated. You can configure this option in the Re-enrollment Rules section. You
can find this section in the Plan Participation tab when you create or edit an absence plan.
If you select Allow Prior Balance Reinstatement, a new row in accruals called "Plan Balance close transaction" is
created that deducts the remaining balance on the last day of the employee. This is the transaction that will act as a
reference to calculate the reinstated balance if the employee is re-hired within the time frame limit configured in the
plan setup.
However, if you select Allow Prior Balance Reinstatement, and leave the Balance Reinstatement Limit and Time
Frame Limit fields blank, the entire closing balance can be reinstated any time.
Vesting Period
Define if you want newly enrolled workers to accrue time, but not use it until after a specific amount of time.
Plan Limits
Define rules for the maximum leave time that workers can accrue. For incremental plans, Absence Management
applies the limit to each accrual period. When there are accrual transactions such as adjustments, balance transfers,
and disbursements, which impact the ceiling or carryover value, then the periodic accrual balance calculation takes
precedence and readjusts the balance accordingly.
Balance Updates
You can enable the following types of adjustments that HR specialists can make during maintenance of absence records
and entitlements:
â¢ Balance transfer across plans
â¢ Other adjustments
â¢ Elective disbursements

Payments
Decide how you want to calculate payment of accrual balances for the following scenarios:
â¢ When workers must be paid a different rate during the absence period
â¢ When a part of the accrual balance must be disbursed to workers as cash
â¢ When the cost of accrual balance must be calculated to determine employer liability
â¢ When the accrual balance must be paid to workers when their plan participation ends
Disbursement
Determine whether workers are eligible for cash disbursement requests. Decide who can initiate the disbursement.
Additionally, define disbursement rules and the number of hours that can be disbursed.
Donation
Define whether workers are eligible to donate accrual balances to a coworker. Decide who can initiate the donation.
Additionally, define donation rules and the number of hours that can be donated.

band of a worker.
 
Example: An organization has a vacation plan in
which enrolled workers accrue a certain number
of days every year based on their grade. When
the grade of a worker changes in the middle of
the calendar year, the organization might want
to prorate their total accrual balance. You can
configure this proration rule using the global
absence accrual event formula to capture the
dates when such changes occur.
 
This formula can't be attached to the plan
definition at any point. When you create
this formula, the formula name needs to be
the same as the absence plan name. This
automatically links the formula to the plan.

Global Absence Accrual Matrix Formula  
The Global Absence Accrual Matrix fast formula can be used in conjunction with the accrual matrix to implement
requirements such as band change proration, FTE proration' and so on.
An organization might have a vacation plan in which workers enrolled into the plan can accrue days every year based on
their grade. If the grade changes mid-period, then the total accrual needs to be prorated based on the amount of time
that the worker spends in each band. This can be achieved by defining an accrual matrix that is based on grades and
using a combination of accrual event formula and accrual matrix formula.

Global Absences Annual Accrual Limit  
The Global Absences Annual Accrual Limit fast formula is used to specify an annual accrual limit for each worker (each

An organization might have an annual accrual limit rule that generally allows a worker in an accrual plan to accrue a
maximum of 30 days. However, the workers in a particular department accrue an additional 5 days due to the nature of
their work. In such cases, this logic can be composed into the fast formula so that when the accrual process determines
the annual accrual limit, the application dynamically allocates different limits to different workers depending on their
department.

Sample Formula
Requirement: The organization has an annual accrual limit rule, which allows workers to accrue up to a maximum of 35
days. This Annual year accrual limit needs to be prorated by FTE of workers who have the jobs âWealth Managementâ or
âTrade Associateâ assigned against their assignment record.
Solution: A Global Absences Annual Accrual Limit Proration fast formula such as the one below can be used.

Global Absence Carryover  
The Global Absence Carryover fast formula can be used in cases where a single carryover rule does not apply to the
entire population that belongs to the accrual plan.
An organization might have a carryover rule that generally allows a maximum of 5 days to be carried over. However, the
workers in a particular department are allowed to carryover an additional 2 days due to the nature of their work. In such
cases, this logic can be composed into the fast formula so that when carryover is calculated, the application dynamically
allocates different carryover limits to different workers depending on their department.

Global Absence Discretionary Disbursement Rule  
This formula type can be used to define the limit of the amount of leave balance that a worker is eligible to request to
be disbursed as cash. The formula returns the minimum and maximum amount of leave balance that can be disbursed,
and also returns an increment, which limits the disbursement amount to specific values between the minimum and
maximum. These attributes are defined as follows.
â¢ The minimum amount of leave balance that the worker is eligible to request a cash disbursement.
â¢ The maximum amount of leave balance that the worker can request, for instances where you want to limit the
amount to a certain number of hours.
â¢ An increment to prevent workers from entering decimal places, and thus avoid rounding issues later.
Note that the output should always be in the absence planâs UOM. Returning negative numbers is not recommended
because this could lead to unexpected behavior while processing the transaction.
You have the option to enter minimum, maximum and increments as flat amounts. But if the limits vary by certain
criteria like the workerâs grade, years of service, hours, then this formula type can be used to meet these requirements.
The organization has a vacation plan from which employees can choose to disburse some of the accrued vacation
balance as cash. For employees with 5 years of service or less, the maximum amount that can be disbursed is 5 days.
For employees that have more than 5 years of service, the maximum amount that can be disbursed increases to 10
days.

Global Absence Elective Disbursement Evaluation
Formula  
The Global Absence Elective Disbursement Evaluation formula is used to validate elective disbursements in an accrual
plan and set payment percentages for the disbursement. The formula can also be used to override the disbursement
amount elected by the worker.
An organization might have a rule such that if an employeeâs accrual balance as of the election date is below a certain
minimum threshold limit, then the disbursement should not be allowed. Whereas, if the balance is between two other
threshold values, then the payment percentage should be 75%. In such cases, you can compose a Global Absence

Global Absence Partial Period Accrual Rate  
The Global Absence Partial Period Accrual Rate fast formula is where any logic required for proration of accrual balance
during enrollment year and disenrollment year needs to be entered.
If the annual accrual that a worker is eligible for every year is 20 days and the worker has enrolled into the plan mid year,
the organization would like to grant the worker 10 days for the year of enrollment since the worker is eligible only for half
the year. Similarly, if a worker disenrolls from a plan mid year, the total accrual for that year would need to be reduced
from 20 to 10 because the worker was enrolled into the plan for only half the year.
This formula is invoked when enrollment or disenrollment dates fall within the repeating period for which the accrual is
being processed.

Global Absence Plan Duration  
The Global Absence Plan Duration fast formula is used to override the default duration calculation logic for daily accrual
duration entries against accrual plans. For example, if the accrual deduction to be considered for an absence entry in
an accrual plan of an organization depends on the location of the worker, then this formula can be leveraged to specify
this dynamic calculation logic. This formula is invoked once for each day of absence. If there are multiple shifts in a day,
then the formula is invoked once for each shift. If the shift spans over a day divide, then the shift is split into two and the
formula is invoked once for each shift block.

Global Absence Plan Enrollment End  
The Global Absence Plan Enrollment End fast formula can be used to over-ride the default enrollment end date rule
for the absence plan when workers are being terminated from the organization or when the Update Accrual Plan
Enrollments batch job is being run.
In an organization the absence plan un-enrollment rule could be such that for termination, workers have to serve a
notice period of one month during which time the worker should not be enrolled into any absence plan. In such a case a
Global Absence Plan Enrollment End formula can be composed to derive this alternate enrollment end date.

Global Absence Plan Enrollment Start  
The Global Absence Plan Enrollment Start fast formula can be used to override the default enrollment start date rule
for the absence plan when workers are being hired into the organization or when the Update Accrual Plan Enrollments

In an organization the absence plan enrollment rule can be configured such that only workers are allowed to enroll into
the plan from the hire date, whereas Interns and Graduates have to complete a waiting period of 1 month before being
enrolled into the plan. In such cases, the Plan Enrollment Start formula can be used to derive the alternate enrollment
date (one that is different from the hire date or the date passed into the parameter when submitting the Update Accrual
Plan Enrollments batch job).

Global Absence Proration  
The Global Absence Proration fast formula can be used to apply a proration factor (or a multiplication factor), onto the
final accrual calculated and returned by the accrual calculation rules in an accrual based absence plan.
If an organization has an accrual plan where the accrual rate varies based on Worker grades, and on top of that if a
multiplication factor such as 0.75 needs to be applied depending on the Worker work location, then the band based on
grades can be defined in the accrual matrix and the multiplication factor of 0.75 based on work location can be defined
in the Global Absence Proration formula.

Global Absence Rollover  
The Global Absence Rollover fast formula can be used in cases where a single rollover limit rule does not apply to the
entire population that belongs to the accrual plan.
An organization might have a rollover rule that generally allows a maximum of 30 days to be rolled over to another plan
at the end of plan year. However, the workers in a particular department are allowed to rollover an additional 10 day. In
such cases, this logic can be composed into the fast formula so that when rollover limit is determined, the application
dynamically allocates different limits to different workers depending on their department.

If the entitlement to be considered against a qualification plan in an organization depends on the location of the Worker,
then this formula can be leveraged to specify this dynamic calculation logic. This formula is invoked once for each day
of absence. If there are multiple shifts in a day, then the formula is invoked once for each shift. If the shift spans over a
day-divide, then the shift is split into two and the formula is invoked once for each shift block.

Global Absence Plan Enrollment Start Date  
The Global Absence Plan Enrollment Start Date fast formula can be used to specify the Qualification date for the
absence plan.
An organization might have a rule for Maternity entitlements according to which the qualification date is on the absence
start date if actual dates are entered. If it is not entered, then the qualification date needs to be the event date (actual if
available, or else, the planned date). For including such conditional logic to determine the qualification date, formulas of
this type can be used.

The Global Absence Entry Validation fast formula can be used in cases where a custom data validation or business rule
validation needs to be performed when an absence entry is being made.
An organization might have a rule that allows a worker to record an absence entry of type Maternity Leave â Unpaid,
only in sequence with a regular Maternity Leave absence entry. In such a case, a validation formula can be composed

Global Absence Linkage Exclusion  
The Global Absence Linkage Exclusion fast formula can be used to define rules for skipping absence entry linkages in
cases where linkage rules have been defined at the absence type setup level.
An organization might have a linkage rule that links together Sickness absences. However, if the Sickness absence entry
is only of a single day duration, the business might wish to exclude the specific absence entry from being linked. In such
a case, a linkage exclusion formula can be composed which checks the duration of the entered absence and informs the
application whether to exclude the absence entry from a potential linkage.

Global Absence Type Duration  
The Global Absence Type Duration fast formula can be used to override the default calculation logic that the application
uses to determine the absence entry duration and accrual plan usage against absence entries.
In an organization when a worker makes an absence entry for an absence type that is measured in Days, there might be
a need to have the total duration pro-rated based on the scheduled work hours of the Worker for those days of absence.
In such a case, a type duration formula can be composed with the required logic of calculating the pro-rated duration so
that it replaces the default duration calculation rules in the application.
The same formula needs to return the required duration when the entry is processed as a single unit (between start
date and end date), as well as when processed for each day between the start and end dates.

Database Items  
In accordance with the fast formula architecture, only database items whose contexts are available within the formula
type maybe used in the various absence formulas. Information about the contexts associated with DBIs and the SQL
WHERE clause behind the DBI is stored in the HCM Cloud database and can be retrieved using the following SQL
query. Replace <ENTER DBI NAME HERE> with the actual DBI name with quotes. This information is to be used to help
determine which DBI should be used in a formula.
SELECT d.base_user_name DBI_NAME
, d.data_type DBI_DATA_TYPE
, d.definition_text SELECT_CLAUSE
, r.text WHERE_CLAUSE
, (select listagg('<' || rcu.sequence_no || ',' || c.base_context_name || '>', ', ')

, ff_routes_b r
where d.base_user_name = <ENTER DBI NAME HERE>
and d.user_entity_id = u.user_entity_id
and r.route_id = u.route_id;
To find all DBIs based on ANC tables use the following query.
SELECT d.base_user_name DBI_NAME

Troubleshooting Tips  
Use the general best practices recommended to compose and troubleshoot fast formulas. You can also use the
following three specific approaches to troubleshoot Absence Management fast formulas:
199
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 6
Formulas for Absence Management
ESS Logs â Calculate Accruals and Balances
Accrual fast formulas are primarily called when the Calculate Accruals and Balances job is submitted. Since this is an
ESS job, it generates a log and output file, which can be leveraged to capture sequence points or variable values in fast
formulas.
In order to print any custom messages or values of variables into the log, the following formula function can be invoked
- ESS_LOG_WRITE(). The format for using the particular formula function is:
lc_variable_to_be_logged = âThe assignment number is : â||HR_ASSIGNMENT_NUMBER
lc_dummy_variable = ESS_LOG_WRITE(lc_variable_to_be_logged)
Assuming the value of HR_ASSIGNMENT_NUMBER in the formula is â123456â, the output of the above statements in the
log would be:
The assignment number is : 123456
When submitting the Calculate Accruals and Balances job, be sure to enable the Include trace statements in audit log
option.
ESS Logs â Evaluate Absences
Every time you enter an absence, you initiate the Global Absence Type Duration formula. Submission of the Evaluate
Absences job for an existing absence entry re-processes the absence entry (including making calls to the absence
duration calculation formula). Since this is an ESS job, it generates a log and output file, which can be leveraged to
capture sequence points or variable values in fast formulas.
In order to print any custom messages or values of variables into the log, the following formula function can be called -
ESS_LOG_WRITE(). The format for using the particular formula function is:
lc_variable_to_be_logged = âThe assignment number is : â||HR_ASSIGNMENT_NUMBER
lc_dummy_variable = ESS_LOG_WRITE(lc_variable_to_be_logged)
Assuming the value of HR_ASSIGNMENT_NUMBER in the formula is â123456â, the output of the above statements in the
log would be:
The assignment number is : 123456
When submitting the Evaluate Absences job, be sure to enable the Include trace statements in audit log option.
UI Error Messages â Global Absence Validation Formula
The Global Absence Entry Validation formula has two return types â VALID and ERROR_MESSAGE. When
submitting the absence entry, if the value in the return type VALID is âNâ, then the text displayed in the return type is
âERROR_MESSAGEâ.
You can add the following statement to the required entry validation formula attached to the absence type:
VALID = âNâ
ERROR_MESSAGE = âThe assignment number is : â||HR_ASSIGNMENT_NUMBER
RETURN VALID, ERROR_MESSAGE
Assuming the value of HR_ASSIGNMENT_NUMBER in the formula is â123456â, the system would try to search in
FND_MESSAGES (accessed via task Manage Messages), for the message âThe assignment number is: 123456â. When the
formula does not find a message defined as such, it would print the following error message.
Cause: The message The assignment number is : 123456, cannot be accessed.

Formulas for Compensation Plans
Using Profiles DBI in Fast Formula  
Profiles DBI can be reported using HRT_PERSON_GENERIC_CONTENT_TYPE_UE.
You can access the DBI associated with this UE only in the formula type: Generic Formula for Profile Content
(HRT_PROFILE_GENERIC_FORMULA_TYPE)
Set these Contexts to create a fast formula using the HRT_PERSON_GENERIC_CONTENT_TYPE_** DBIs.
â¢ EFFECTIVE_DATE
â¢ PERSON_ID
â¢ TALENT_PROFILE_CONTENT_TYPE
Any another formula type which also sets these three Contexts will be able to check the DBI items from the
above UE. However among the seeded Formula Types only the Generic Formula for Profile Content requires
these 3 contexts. Hence currently we can only use the this Formula Type for formulas based on the Profiles DBIs
(HRT_PERSON_GENERIC_CONTENT_TYPE_** , .e.g. HRT_PERSON_GENERIC_CONTENT_TYPE_ITEM_TEXT240_1).
In case you require these DBIs in other formula types, call the Profile formula from within your own Formula (it can be
another type e.g. Compensation Default and Override). However you need to set all the required CONTEXTS.
Note:  If you are using Enhanced T alent Profiles, when you use the context TALENT_PROFILE_CONTENT_TYPE, you
will see data for all the sections that are associated with your specific content type or template. You must loop through
the data retrieved and use the attribute SECTION_CONTEXT to find the specific profile section data you are looking
for.
Use Profiles DBI in Fast Formula by following these steps:
1. Create a new Fast Formula of the formula type "Generic Formula type for Profile Content".
2. Set the context values: Person Id, Effective Date and TALENT_PROFILE_CONTENT_TYPE. Include
the DBI values customer to be used in Compensation Fast Formula in the return statement like
HRT_PERSON_GENERIC_CONTENT_TYPE_ITEM_TEXT240_1 etc...
3. Use the above created Fast Formula in Compensation Formula "Default and Override". Set the context values
(Person Id, Effective Date and TALENT_PROFILE_CONTENT_TYPE) for the above Profiles Fast Formula created
in Step1 before calling the Profiles Fast Formula.
4. Reference the Profiles Fast Formula from Compensation Fast Formula to get the values present in the Return
statement of Profiles Fast Formula.
5. Use these Return values in the Compensation Fast Formula.

Overview of Benefits Formulas  
Use formulas to configure your plan design to the requirements of your enterprise.
They provide a flexible alternative to delivered business rules for such purposes as:
â¢ Date calculations, such as:
â¦ Enrollment start and end dates
â¦ Rate or coverage start and end dates
â¦ Waiting periods and enrollment periods
â¦ Action item due dates
â¢ Calculations of rate and coverage amount, minimum and maximum, or upper and lower limits
â¢ Certification requirements
â¢ Partial month and proration calculations
â¢ Eligibility and participation evaluation
For example, you can write a formula to calculate benefits eligibility for those cases where the provided eligibility criteria
don't accommodate your particular requirements.
A formula can return more than one value to a calling package. In Benefits, different packages which call the formula
expect outputs to be returned differently. Based on the formula type, the number and data types of values to be
returned are predefined. Some packages expect the predefined names for output variables; the order of a variable in the
return statement does not matter. Some packages expect the return variables to be returned in a certain order; in this
case the name of output variable does not matter. If predefined names are expected to be used and the formula does
not use the expected names, the process would error out at run time.

Sample Formula 5:
Problem statement: Customer is loading participant enrollments using HDL. They have a post-election edit formula
which forces workers to enroll dependents in order to submit elections. When loading participant enrollments using
HDL, this formula is getting triggered and the enrollments are not getting loaded.
While conversion load is being performed, you can remove the formula from plan design, perform the load for
participant and dependents and then add it back.
Other option is to use below formula functions -
â¢ BEN_GET_PROCESS_NAME_SS() is provided for Spreadsheet loader
â¢ BEN_GET_PROCESS_NAME() is provided for HDL Enrollment
When using participant HDL, you can use code like below to skip these validations while loading enrollments -
optext= BEN_GET_PROCESS_NAME() if ( optext != âPARTICIPANT_ENROLLMENTâ) then ( 'your checks go here' )
For other 2 HDL loaders, the values you can use are -
â¢ Dependent Enrollment using HDL - 'DEPENDENT_DESIGNATION'
â¢ Beneficiary Enrollment using HDL - 'BENEFICIARY_DESIGNATION'

Common Mistakes in Formulas  
Here are some common mistakes that occur while using formulas:
Sample 1
Mistake description
Callout Description
1 Ensure that you include all the relevant DB items within the change context scope. Not including them
within the changed scope leads to inconsistent results.
2 Ensure that you increment or initialize the index
3 Ensure that you enter correct return variable names for certain formula types instead of specific
variable names.

Mistake description
Callout Description
1 When you use array DB items, you need not use the below functions, as the array DB items allow you to
access other enrollment details like original enrollment dates and, benefit amounts.
Sample 4
Mistake description
Callout Description
1 Ensure tht you don't have unsused DB items and varables in your formula. They can throw errors at run
time, requiring you to recompile formulas.
2 Use canonical date formats while initializing date variables to avoid date format related errors at
runtime.

Sample 5
Mistake description
Callout Description
1 DB items don't return enrolled plan or option names when enrollments begin from a later date in future
due to first of next month or other similar coverage codes.
2 Manipulate the effective date as per your needs and enclose the above WHILE loop within the change
context call.

Sample 6
Mistake description
Callout Description
1 DB items are available for formulas based on data partitioning and formula context usages. So not all
formulas can access all DB items. In this example, BEN_PBB_VAL DB item is not available to coverage
calculation formula type. We recommend that you use Enterprise level formulas within Benefits. Don't
set LDG while creating formulas.
2 Ensure that the called function is executable before you call the function.
3 Use the extract rule which has access to BEN_PBB_VAL DB item.

Formula Debugging and Troubleshooting  
You need to place the following debug statements as necessary:
l_log_data = ESS_LOG_WRITE('*************Start ff debug - messages appear in
the batch process log files')
ret = HR_TRACE('*************Start ff debug - messages appear in the PLSQL
trace file')
.
.
.
.
l_log_data = ess_log_write('end ff debug: L_MX_CVG_ALWD_AMT'||to_char(L_MAX_CVG_ALWD_AMT))
ret = HR_TRACE('end ff debug: L_MX_CVG_ALWD_AMT'||to_char(L_MX_CVG_ALWD_AMT))
Formula Troubleshooting
If the formula doesn't return the correct values or if the end result is not as expected, then here's how you can diagnose
the issue:
1. Test with the seeded codes first. You need to remove the formula before testing the seeded functionality.
2. Use hard coded Values and test a simple fast formula.
3. If you used any function, then replace them with hard coded values and test.
4. Trace the formula to gather details of the values passed.
5. If the above steps don't help you resolve the problem, then provide the results of the same for oracle to review.
While troubleshooting the formula, you need to ensure the following:
1. Don't delete a formula which has been attached to benefits plan design, especially after the plan design has
been processed, and participants have been found eligible for the plan design.
2. Don't recreate the formula with the same name after deleting. It doesn't reinstate the older behaviour. You
would face errors at runtime. Instead, edit the formula or create a new formula to replace the older one.

Appendix 4: Formula Errors: Compile time  
Here are the descriptions of the various formula errors during the compile time:
Formula errors table
Formula Error Description
Syntax Error The formula text violates the grammatical rules for the formula language.
Example: Using IF1 instead of IF for an IF statement.
 
Incorrect Statement Order ALIAS, DEFAUL T, or INPUT statements appear after other statements.
Misuse of ASSIGNMENT Statement An ASSIGNMENT assigns a value to a database item.
A context is assigned a value externally to a CHANGE-CONTEXTS statement.
 
A non-context variable is assigned a value within a CHANGE-CONTEXTS statement.
 
Misuse of ALIAS Statement An ALIAS statement may only be used for a database item.
Missing DEFAUL T Statement A database item with defaulting specified must have a DEFAUL T statement.
Misuse of DEFAUL T Statement A DEFAUL T statement is specified for a variable other than an input or database item.
Uninitialized Variable The compiler detects that a variable is uninitialized when used. The compiler cannot do in all cases.
This error often occurs when the intention is to use a database item, but the database item is not
available to the formula (it does not exist, or partitioning restrictions mean itâs not available to the
formula).
 
Missing Function Call A function call is not recognised. The combination of return type, function name, and parameter types
does not match any available function.
Incorrect Operator Usage An instance of formula operator use does not match the permitted uses of that operator.
Example: The + operator has two permitted uses. The operands are both of data type NUMBER, or
both of data type TEXT.
 
Inconsistent Data Type Usage A formula variable is being used as if it is of more than one data type.
Example: Variable A is assigned a NUMBER value at the start of the formula, but a TEXT value later in
the formula.
 
A database item or context is being used with the wrong data type.
 
EXIT Statement Not Within WHILE Loop
Mixed Use of Context A variable is later used as a context or vice versa.
Example: AREA1 is assigned a value so itâs used as an ordinary variable, but later AREA1 is used as a
context in a GET_CONTEXT call.

Appendix 5: Formula Errors: Run time  
Here are the descriptions of the various formula errors during the run time:
Formula errors table
Formula Error Description
Uninitialized Context A context is not set when required for a database item or function call.
Uninitialized Variable Where the formula compiler cannot fully determine whether or not a variable or context is initialized
when used, it generates code to test whether or not the variable is initialized.
When the formula executes and the variable or context is not initialized an error is raised.
 
Divide by Zero This error is raised when a numeric value is divided by zero.
No Data Found This error is raised when a database item of a non-array type unexpectedly fails to return any data. If
the database item can return no data then it should allow defaulting.
This error can also be raised from within a formula function. The cause is an error in the formula
function code.
 
Too Many Rows This error is raised when a database item of a non-array type unexpectedly returns more than a single
row of data. The cause is an incorrect assumption made about the data being accessed.
This error can also be raised from within a formula function. The cause is an error in the formula
function code.
 
NULL Data Found This error is raised when a database item unexpectedly returns a NULL data value.
If the database item can return a NULL value then it should allow defaulting.
 
Value Exceeded Allowable Range This error is raised for a variety of reasons such as exceeding the maximum allowable length of a
string.
Invalid Number This error is raised when an attempt is made to convert a non-numeric string to a number.
User Defined Function Error This error is raised from within a formula function. The error message text is output as part of the
formula error message.
External Function Call Error A formula function returned an error, but did not provide any additional information to the formula
code. The function might have output error information to the logging destination for the executing
code.
Function Returned NULL Value A formula function returned a NULL value.
Too Many Iterations A single WHILE loop, or a combination of WHILE loops, has exceeded the maximum number of
permitted iterations. The error is raised to terminate loops that could go on forever. This indicates a
programming error within the formula.
Array Data Value Not Set The formula attempted to access an array index that has no data value. This is an error in the formula
code.
Invalid Type Parameter for WSA_EXISTS An invalid data type was specified in the WSA_EXISTS call.
Incorrect Data Type For Stored Item When retrieving an item using WSA_GET, the item's actual data type does not match that of the stored
item. This is an error within the calling formula.
351
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 8
Formulas for Benefits
Formula Error Description
Called Formula Not Found The called formula could not be resolved when attempting to call a formula from a formula. This could
be due to an error in the calling formula, or because of installation issues.
Recursive Formula Call An attempt was made to call a formula from itself. The call could be directly or indirectly via another
called formula. Recursive formula calling is not permitted.
Input Has Different Types In Called and
Calling Formulas
When calling a formula from a formula, the actual formula input data type within the called formula
does not match the data type specified from the calling formula.
Output Has Different Types In Called and
Calling Formulas
When calling a formula from a formula, the actual formula output data type within the called formula
does not match the data type specified from the calling formula.
Too Many Formula Calls There are two many formula from formula calls. This is a problem with the formulas.

How You Use Fast Formulas in Performance Documents  
You can configure fast formulas to calculate section ratings for workers in a performance document.
Fast Formulas and Database Items
Fast formulas contain the items and rules used to calculate the section rating, and can be based on ratings provided
on the items by workers, managers, and participants. You create the fast formulas using the Performance Rating
Calculation type. To the fast formula you add Database Items (DBI). These items can calculate ratings on attributes
besides the overall item rating. For example, you can use DBIs to rate other attributes on a goal, such as the
measurement attributes, rather than the overall goal. You create fast formulas using the Manage Fast Formulas task in
the Setup and Maintenance work area.
For more information, see the Complete List of HRA Database Items for Calculated Ratings (Doc ID 2444793.1) on My
Oracle Support at http://support.oracle.com.
Calculated Rating Setup in the Performance Template Section and
Performance Template
You configure the sections of the performance document to use fast formulas. Fast formulas can calculate ratings for
the Overall Summary, Profile Content (Competencies), Performance Goals, and Development Goals sections. You can set
up any, or all, these sections in a performance document to calculate ratings.
In the section, you must select the fast formula calculation rule. In addition, you select the fast formula rule. To use
calculated ratings, you must also select the option to use calculated ratings on the Process tab of the performance
template. You also must select which roles can see calculated ratings.

Rule Templates, Rules, and Rule Sets for Time and Labor 
You configure time validations, processing, and compliance using fast formula, rule templates, rules, and rule sets.
Rule Templates
Rule templates make it easy to adapt a formula for use with different rules. The formula parameters and outputs are
easy to identify and configure in a template. You don't have to work with the whole formula statement to figure out what
details you must change to achieve a particular result.
The rule template makes sure that you satisfy these conditions:
â¢ The parameters are of the correct parameter type.
â¢ The output uses only specific time attributes.
â¢ The correct number of outputs is associated with the formula results.
Rules
When you create a rule, you select a template to use rather than a formula. The template automatically populates the
description of all outputs and helps you enter correct parameter values. You can create multiple rules from a single
template, varying the parameter and output values of each rule. For example, you create two rules using a time entry
rule template for maximum period. The defined maximum limit of the rules is 36 and 40 hours, respectively.
Rule Type Description Rule Use Example
Advanced time category Defines advanced conditions that you then
associate with a time category.
Create time interaction rules to find time events
or time entries that don't match published
schedule times.
Time calculation Creates or updates time card entries and uses
the data to create calculated results based on
formula logic.
Handle overtime or premium pay by updating
reported time or creating additional calculated
time.
Time device Evaluates time events imported from time
collection devices and creates time entry
exceptions.
Create time entry exceptions for entries
affected by time reported outside the specified
grace period.
Time entry Validates time card entries and generates a
message with a defined severity.
When reported time exceeds a specified weekly
maximum, display the specified message.
Time submission Determines when to automatically save and
submit time card entries created with time
events imported from time collection devices.
Automatically save a time card after each Out
application event.

Formula Types, Contexts, Functions, and Input Attributes
for Workforce Management
Rule Type Description Rule Use Example
Workforce compliance Identifies upcoming compliance exceptions by
reviewing time card data and unprocessed time
events to help you prevent or quickly fix any
exceptions.
Notify managers when young people are
approaching mandated worked time limits.
Rule Sets
A rule set is a date-effective collection of rules or rule sets of the same type. Effective dates enable you to add, delete,
and edit rules and embedded rule sets within the rule set. You associate rule sets to groups of workers with similar time

Header Indicator Description
Rule Classification Choice list with the values applicable to time calculation rules
Rule Execution Type Specify whether rules must create additional hours or update existing hours. This indicator displays
only for time calculation rule templates when the associated formula includes this indicator.
 
Examples:
 
â¢ Create: Rule processing creates total calculated time of 12 hours, which is 2 hours more than the
reported time. This keeps the 10 hours of Regular time at the regular hourly rate. It also creates 2
hours of Premium time at .5 times the regular hourly rate.
Calculation example: (10 hours * 10 USD) + (2 hours * 5 USD) = 110 USD
â¢ Update: Rule processing creates total calculated time of 10 hours, which matches the reported
time. Processing adjusts the pay rate for 2 of the 10 reported hours. It does this with 8 hours of
Regular time at the regular hourly rate, and 2 hours of Overtime at 1.5 times the regular hourly
rate
Calculation example: (8 hours * 10 USD) + (2 hours * 15 USD) = 110 USD
Summation Level Specify at what level the rule applies. This indicator displays only when the associated formula includes
this indicator.
 
â¢ Details: Process the rule against all time entries that match the time category condition.
â¢ Day: Process the rule against hours entered for the entire day that match the time category
conditions.
â¢ Time Card: Process the rule against hours entered for the entire period that match the time
category conditions.
WORKFORCE_MANAGEMENT_TIME_DEVICE_RULES
Formula Type  
To create formulas that evaluate time device events, use the time device rule formula type. Also create time entry
exceptions, when appropriate. You can select only formulas with this formula type when you create time device rule
templates.

WORKFORCE_MANAGEMENT_SUBROUTINE Formula
Type  
Fast formulas have many limitations, including that you can't create functions or procedures inside the formula. This
formula type is a workaround for that limitation. You use this formula type to create formulas that provide specific
functionality for parent formulas.
380
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 10
Formula Types, Contexts, Functions, and Input Attributes
for Workforce Management
Because this formula type isn't associated with any rule template type, you can't select it when you create rule
templates. You can call this formula in formulas of other formula types.
WORKFORCE_MANAGEMENT_UTILITY Formula Type  
This formula type has functionality that's very similar to the WORKFORCE_MANAGEMENT_SUBROUTINE formula type.
You can use the WORKFORCE_MANAGEMENT_SUBROUTINE and WORKFORCE_MANAGEMENT_ UTILITY formula
types interchangeably.
When you use the most appropriate type, people can more easily determine which formulas are function-specific and
which formulas are general utility for all formulas.
Formula Contexts for Workforce Management  
Formula contexts of different types define the formula's application-specific execution context. Control this context by
setting context values for the formula. These contexts affect database item and formula function values. Usually, you
set context values immediately before calling a formula.
You can now include context values in formula expressions, so you no longer have to set context values on entering a
formula. You can test whether a context value is set, and modify the execution context of a formula in the formula.
Context Description
HWM_FFS_ID Most workforce management functions use the unique fast formula session ID and rule ID as a key
identifier for logs and work area related record processing.
 
For more details, see the next topic on Workforce Management functions.
 
HWM_SUMMATION_LEVEL The summation level comes from the rule template page and indicates how to summarize time cards.
This table describes the valid values.
 
Valid Value Description
DETAIL Process each record individually. Usually no summation is required.
DAY Sum and calculate values on a daily basis.
TIMECARD Sum and calculate values for the entire time card period.
 
HWM_RECORD_POSITION The record position value indicates the type of record getting processed. This table describes the valid
values.
 
381
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 10
Formula Types, Contexts, Functions, and Input Attributes
for Workforce Management
Context Description
Valid Value Description
DETAIL Detail record
END_DAY End of day record; enables day summation calculation
END_PERIOD End period record; the last record for the time card
 
The fast formula gets the time card records in this sequence, repeating the steps for each day of the
time card period:
 
1. Detail records for the time card day, sorted in a predefined order.
2. End of day record for the day.
The end period record for the time card is the final record that the formula gets from the time card.
 
Note:  Applies to nonAP formulas only. For AP formulas, use HWM_CTXARY_RECORD_POSITIONS
in the 'Inputs Are...' parameter instead of HWM_RECORD_POSITION context.
HWM_RULE_ID The rule ID is the key for the rule currently getting processed. This key is used to get parameter values
set in the rule and, in combination with HWM_FFS_ID, to store and retrieve work area values.
HWM_PROJECT_ID The project ID associated with the time card record currently getting processed.
HWM_RESOURCE_ID The resource ID or person ID associated with the time card record currently getting processed.
HWM_CTX_SEARCH_END_DATE The end date used to search for the relevant records to process.
HWM_CTX_SEARCH_START_DATE The start date used to search for the relevant records to process.
HWM_MEASURE_DAY The total measure for the time card day to use when processing records. Measure is a quantity,
 typically of hours, but it can also be units.
HWM_MEASURE_PERIOD The total measure for the time card period to use when processing records. Measure is a quantity,
 typically of hours, but it can also be units.
HWM_SUBRESOURCE_ID The subresource ID or assignment ID associated with the time card record currently getting processed.
HWM_CTX_PERIOD_END_DATE Date identifying the end of the time card period used to process records.
HWM_CTX_PERIOD_START_DATE Date identifying the start of the time card period used to process records.
HWM_ALLOCATION_DATA_LEVEL The summation level comes from the allocation page and indicates how to summarize time entries for
the allocation. This table describes the valid values.
 
Valid Value Description
DAY Sum and calculate values on a daily basis.
TIMECARD Sum and calculate values for the entire time card period.
 
HWM_ALLOCATION_ID The allocation ID is the key for the allocation currently getting processed.
382
Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Resources
Administering Fast Formulas
Chapter 10
Formula Types, Contexts, Functions, and Input Attributes
for Workforce Management
Context Description
HWM_ALLOCATION_RULE_ID The allocation rule ID is the key for the time calculation rule currently getting processed. This key is
used to get parameter values set in the rule and allocation. It's also used in combination with HWM_
FFS_ID to store and retrieve work area values.
 
This ID is different from the normal rule ID because it refers to different conditions in the allocation
definition. Each source that makes up an allocation has a different rule and rule ID.
 
HWM_ALLOCATION_START_DATE The date when the allocation becomes effective and the time calculation rule can use it.
GRP_TYPE_ID The ID for the group type associated with the worker time processing profile containing the rule that is
currently processing time card records.
HWM_REPEATING_TM_PERIOD_ID The ID for the repeating period associated with the worker time processing profile containing the rule
that is currently processing time card records.
Workforce Management Functions  
Fast formula methods work only between fast formula calls. Workforce Management passes records from Java
programs and these values must be stored during the call, so you must use these workforce management functions to
store and retrieve values between calls.
Don't use fast formula working storage area methods, such as WSA_GET and WSA_SET.

DAVE_TIME_SCAN_SET Function  
The DAVE time scan set function is the first function that you include in relevant formulas. Use this function to select
and prepare data for processing similar to (vo.executeQuery).
The function caches the identified data so that all subsequent calls to these DAVE functions are free. That is they
don't involve database queries or selections: DAVE_TIME_SCAN_REC_DAY, DAVE_TIME_SCAN_REC_DTL, and
DAVE_TIME_SCAN_REC_TOTAL.

templates.
Parameter
Name Type Description
PAYTYPES_TO_VALIDATE Fixed text List of comma-separated payroll time types that
identify the reported time to compare with the
schedule. If blank or equal to null, the formula
uses all payroll time types.
Function
The formula output is True if the reported time doesnât match the scheduled time and is outside the grace period.
Example
A time category includes the formula as an advanced condition. An attestation set with an attestation that appears
when the formula finds a schedule deviation includes the time category.
The person reporting time is scheduled to work the Morning shift (6a to 11a), which has these limits:
â¢ Grace period: 5 minutes

Example
The person has an attestation set that includes a meal break attestation. The attestation time category from this
attestation set helps identify a clock out more than 5 hours after the previous clock in. Because the elapsed duration is
more than 5 hours, the meal break attestation appears. When the person confirms that they didnât take a meal break,
they get asked why--personal or business reasons? If it was for business reasons, the formula generates the specified
payroll time entry.

ORA_WFM_TCR_ALLOCATION_TIME_AP Fast Formula  
This fast formula is associated with the delivered rule template Time Allocation Template. If the person has a time
allocation assigned by the Manage Allocation Assignments task, then the formula uses this allocation. Otherwise, it
uses the allocation selected in the rule configuration. In both cases, the allocation formula uses either reported or
calculated time, depending on the processing sequence of the allocation rule in the rule set. The formula allocates the
time identified by the source time category across the output time attributes. This formula uses an array to process time
data.
If you want the review page of the time card to show the cost segment outputs configured in the time allocation,
complete these tasks:
1. Configure the time review layouts for workers and managers accordingly.
2. Associate the appropriate layout set with the worker time entry profiles.
Parameter
Name Type Description
ASSIGN_FRACTION_TO_LAST_ROW Yes or No Indicates whether to adjust the last row of the
time allocation output so that total allocated
hours match the number of hours identified by
the allocation rule. The time allocations that use
this parameter have either the type Percent or
Equally.
Outputs
This formula has no output variables. It uses the outputs configured for the time allocation assigned to the person when
the rule runs.
Examples of Percentage Allocations
Example 1: The reported time doesn't include any conflicts with the person's assigned allocation.

ORA_WFM_TCR_OT_EARNED_DAYS_FOR_ENTRIES_THAT_SPAN_DAYS
Fast Formula  
This fast formula is associated with the delivered rule template Time Entries That Span Overtime and Earned Days AP. It
determines whether time entries span days. If they do, the formula determines these days:
â¢ The day to use in calculations that include reported time entries that span days
â¢ The earned day for reported time entries that span days
By default, the formula uses rule parameter values. When the rule doesn't pass any values, the formula uses the values
of the person's work day definition. This formula uses an array to process time card data.
Parameters
Name Type Description
OVERTIME_DAY_START_TIME Time HH:MM Time in hours and minutes that marks the start
of the day to use in time calculation rules that
calculate overtime.
EARNED_RESOLVE_SPAN_RULE Fixed text Rule to use to determine the earned day for
reported time entries that span days. Valid
values are:
 
â¢ START_DAY: Time calculation rules should
treat time entries as being entirely on the
start day.
â¢ STOP_DAY: Time calculation rules should
treat time entries as being entirely on the
stop day.
â¢ SPLIT_AT_DAY_START: Time calculation
rules should split time entries at the time
where one day ends and the other starts.
EARNED_GROUPING_THRESHOLD Fixed number Threshold, in minutes, used to group reported
time entries on one or another of the multiple
days.
ORA_HWM_FF_DAY_BREAKER_FLAG Exclude Internal indicator to split the day. Doesnât show
on the rule pages.

Time Calculation Rule Fast Formula
Outputs
This formula has no outputs shown on the rule template or rule.
Function
The function specifies to resolve time entries that span days using the rule {EARNED_RESOLVE_SPAN_RULE} for earned
day. It automatically uses the rule SPLIT_AT_DAY_START for overtime. For this rule, the day start time is midnight and
the threshold for grouping time entries on one day or the other is {EARNED_GROUPING_THRESHOLD} minutes. When
determining the overtime day, the day start time is {OVERTIME_DAY_START_TIME}.
ORA_WFM_TCR_THRESHOLD_WITH_EVENT_CHANGES_MSR_AP
Fast Formula  
This sample fast formula determines whether daily reported time should be updated to include an overtime entry. If it
does, the formula updates the existing reported time to the value stored on the assignment record.
In this formulaâs case, the assignment value is a descriptive flexfield named OT Hours Threshold. OT Hours Threshold
maps to Assignment Attribute2, which gets the initial value from the PER_ASG_ATTRIBUTE2 database item and the
event from ASS_ATTRIBUTE2. The formula also adds an overtime entry with the remaining reported time. If the stored
value changes in the middle of the time card period, the formula uses the new stored value to calculate overtime for the
subsequent days. To check whether the stored overtime value changed, the event database items use the person ID for
the time card individual, the time card period, and the assignment OT Hours Threshold field. This formula uses an array
to process time data.
Parameters
Name Type Description
WORKED_TIME_CONDITION Time category Time category that identifies the time entries to
use to determine the hours under and over the
thresholds
DEFAUL T_HOURS_BEFORE_OVERTIME Fixed number Default hours limit, which is used if the initial
assignment and event threshold values are Null.
Outputs
Name Output Group Time Attribute Description
OUT_GRP1_MEASURE_UNDER 1 Measure Calculated hours under the daily
threshold
OUT_GRP1_START_TIME_UNDER 1 StartTime Start time under the daily

OUT_GRP2_MEASURE_OVER 2 Measure Calculated hours over the daily
threshold
OUT_GRP2_START_TIME_OVER 2 StartTime Start time over the daily threshold
OUT_GRP2_STOP_TIME_OVER 2 StopTime Stop time over the daily threshold
Function
This formula calculates daily overtime using rule inputs stored on the assignment record. The inputs can change
over the time card period, so you use this formula to get the correct value for each day. This way the daily overtime
calculation results are always accurate.
This formula sums the daily time entries identified by the WORKED_TIME_CONDITION and uses the specified overtime
threshold to calculate daily overtime.
â¢ If the assignment OT Hours Threshold descriptive flexfield is Null, the formula uses the
DEFAUL T_HOURS_BEFORE_OVERTIME value.
â¢ If the flexfield value isn't Null, the formula uses the PER_ASG_ATTRIBUTE2 database item value of
PER_ASG_ASSIGNMENT_DETAILS Route (PER_ALL_ASSIGNMENTS_M table), for the overtime threshold.
To get any changes to the OT Hours Threshold field from the events table, the formula uses the
ORA_HWM_PROCESS_EVENTS_CHG_RN route database items.
Example
Scenario: You store people's overtime thresholds on the OT Hours Threshold descriptive flexfield. The initial threshold
value for Chris, who works 40 hours a week is 8, but changes on Wednesday to 10.
Example: You create a rule with your template where the default daily threshold is 8 hours. The time category is All
Payroll Time Types and the payroll time type for calculated hours over the threshold is Overtime.

Fast Formula  
This fast formula is associated with the delivered rule template Day Periods and Seventh Day Threshold Template. It
compares the total daily, period, or seventh consecutive day hours identified by the time category the corresponding
threshold values.
It converts hours over the threshold to a single payroll time type. It leaves hours under the threshold as the same payroll
time type or converts them to a new payroll time type. This formula uses an array processing formula.

daily threshold
OUT_MEASURE_OVER_1 2 Measure Calculated hours between the first
and second daily thresholds
OUT_MEASURE_OVER_2 3 Measure Calculated hours over the second
daily threshold
Function
The general overtime provision requires that people get 1.5 times their regular pay rate when they work more than X
hours a day or more than Y hours a week. People can work more than X hours a day or more than 6 days a week if they
get overtime pay according to these tiers.
â¢ The first overtime tier includes all hours worked beyond X hours, up to and including X2 hours in a day. It also
includes the first X hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of the week.
â¢ The second overtime tier includes all hours worked beyond X2 hours in a day. It also includes all hours worked
in excess of X on the seventh consecutive day of the week.
Daily Rule:
â¢ Overtime is based on 2 threshold values or parameters.
â¢ Hours worked under the first threshold get paid at the regular rate.
â¢ Hours worked over the first threshold and under the second threshold get paid at an overtime rate of 1.5 times
the regular rate.
â¢ Hours worked over the second threshold get paid at an overtime rate of 2 times the regular rate.

Weekly Rule:
â¢ Overtime is based on 1 threshold value or parameter.
â¢ Hours worked under the first threshold get paid at the regular rate.
â¢ Hours worked over the first threshold get paid at an overtime rate of 1.5 times the regular rate.
Assumption in processing order:
1. The rule that checks for and processes any seventh day worked hours runs first. Typically, US rules use a
threshold of 8 hours and calculate hours under the threshold as overtime and over it as double time.
2. The daily rules that check thresholds and process any worked hours run next. Typically, US rules have these
configurations:
â¦ Daily double time rule (X2): The daily threshold is 12 hours with calculated hours under the threshold as
regular and over it as double time.
â¦ Daily overtime rule (X): The daily threshold is 8 hours with calculated hours under the threshold as
regular and over it as overtime.
3. The weekly rule that checks the threshold and processes any worked hours runs last. Typically, US rules use a
threshold of 40 hours and calculate hours under the threshold as regular and over it as overtime.
Examples
Scenario: The person's rule set includes the following four rules, created with this formula.

Function
Compares the total hours identified by the time category, which might include absence time, for the day or with the

the threshold, it either keeps the attribute or converts the attribute to a new payroll time type attribute.
Examples
Scenario: You don't include a payroll time type for calculated hours under the threshold because you want to use those
of the reported time entries. You add a payroll time type output for calculated hours over the threshold to use instead of
the reported time type. Also, Sick and Jury Duty are payroll time attributes instead of absence time attributes.
You create a rule with your template where the weekly threshold is 40 hours and the time category is All Payroll Time

is Overtime.
Example 1: The person's hours total to 48 for the time card period when it includes absence time.
â¢ If your rule execution type is Update, then on Friday, the rule splits the calculated hours. It keeps the hours
under the 40-hour threshold associated with the reported payroll time type. It associates the calculated hours
over the threshold with the Overtime payroll time type.
â¢ If your rule execution type is Create, the rule keeps all calculated hours associated with the existing payroll time

OUT_MEASURE_OVER 2 Measure Calculated premium hours
Function
The function compares the total variable day hours identified by the time category with the threshold value. It coverts
hours over the threshold to a single payroll time type attribute. For hours under the threshold, it either keeps the
attribute or converts the attribute to a new payroll time type attribute. The function defines the variable day by the start
time of the first entry after a specified time. The day calculation considers all entries from the first time entry time until
just before the same time on the next day, unless the person got an insufficient break during the variable day. If the
person did get an insufficient break, the function includes entries after the same time on the next day, in the overtime
calculation for the first day. This formula requires start and end time entries. The calculation splits hours entries that
span midnight and the calculated hours appear separately on each day. The summation level is Detailed.
Examples
Scenario: You don't include a payroll time type for calculated hours under the threshold because you want to use those
of the reported time entries. You add a payroll time type output for calculated hours over the threshold to use instead
of the reported time type. Also, Sick and Jury Duty are payroll time attributes instead of absence time attributes. You
create a rule with your template with these parameters:
â¢ The new day starts with a time entry at or after 10:00p.
â¢ The break length minimum is 3 hours.
â¢ The threshold is 8 hours.
â¢ The time category is All Payroll Time Types.
Example 1: The time entries have more than 3 hours between them and no time entry starts before the shift start time.
Day Payroll Time Type Reported Time Calculated Time
Mon thru Fri Regular 6a to 2p 8h
Example 2: The person works an extra shift that starts an hour before the usual shift start time. This start causes the
entire shift to count as part of the same variable day, thus qualifying the person for overtime.

person's shift starts less than 3 hours after the end of the previous shift. So even though this is a new day, the rule

14  Work Day Definition and Time Calculation
Rule Fast Formula
Work Day Definition Example  
This example shows the differences between the earned day definition (ActualDate) and overtime day definition
(RefDate).
The earned day definition(ActualDate) has the spanning days rule as Start day and the grouping threshold as 180
minutes.
â¢ For any time entry that crosses midnight, the ActualDate is the date of the entry StartTime. For example, if the
StartTime is 2019-Nov-10 07:00, then the ActualDate is 2019-Nov-10.
â¢ For any time entry that starts less than 180 minutes after the previous entry stops, the ActualDate is the date of
the previous entry's StartTime.
The overtime day definition has the day start time as 5:00p of the current day. For any time entry between 5:00p today
and 5:00p tomorrow, the RefDate is today's date. For example, the RefDate for the entry 2019-Nov-12 13:00 to 2019-
Nov-12 16:00 is 2019-Nov-11.
For any time entry that starts before and stops after 5:00p, the entry is split between the previous and current days, or
yesterday and today. For example, the entry 2019-Nov-12 15:00 to 2019-Nov-12 19:00 is split into 2 entries: 2019-Nov-12
15:00 to 2019-Nov-12 17:00 and 2019-Nov-12 17:00 to 2019-Nov-12 19:00 The RefDate is 2019-Nov-11 for the first entry
and 2019-Nov-12 for the second entry.

Delivered Time Calculation Rule Threshold Formulas Use
Starttime  
Delivered formulas summarize at the day and time card levels, depending on the date of the start time. They don't use
the ActualDate or RefDate generated from the person's work day definition.
Here are detailed results for the sample November 11 through 17, 2019 time card. The person reported time for Monday
through Wednesday, November 11 through 13. Any time that they worked above an 8-hour daily threshold is overtime.

Work Day Definition and Time Calculation Rule Fast
Formula
For example, if someone works 10 hours in a day, 8 hours is calculated as regular time and 2 hours as overtime.
Hours over and under the threshold are determined using StartTime and the overtime work day--5:00p to 5:00p. The
delivered threshold formulas determine that the person worked 15 hours on November 11 because all 3 entries start on
that day. The ActualDate for all 9 hours of the third entry on November 11 is the same as the date for the start time. The
RefDate is also the same, because the start and stop times of that entry are within the 5:00p to 5:00p work day. The
ActualDate for the first time entry on 2019-Nov-12 is 2019-Nov-11 because there's less than 180 minutes between when it
starts and the 2019-Nov-12 03:00 entry stops.

The daily total is calculated using either the ActualDate or RefDate instead of the start time. Both dates still use the
overtime work day. Time worked above the 8-hour daily ActualDate or RefDate threshold is overtime. The explanations
for ActualDate and RefDate both use November 11, because both daily totals have ActualDates and RefDates for
November 11. Only RefDate has entries for November 10.

Formula
â¢ Calculated Overtime by ActualDate: Because the threshold is 8 hours, the formula splits the 2019-Nov-11 18:00
to 2019-Nov-12 03:00 entry into these two entries:
â¦ The regular 2019-Nov-11 18:00 to 2019-Nov-11 20:00 entry
â¦ The overtime 2019-Nov-11 20:00 -- 2019-Nov-12 03:00 entry
But the overtime entry spans working days. So the formula splits it into 2 overtime entries: 2019-Nov-11 20:00
to 2019-Nov-12 00:00 and 2019-Nov-12 00:00 to 2019-Nov-12 03:00. Because the 2019-Nov-12 05:00 entry
starts less than 180 minutes after the end of the previous entry, it too is included in the overtime calculation for
November 11.

The formula uses the scheduled time and limits to check the reported start time against shift limits in this order:
1. If it's between 7:15a and 7:45a, the formula displays the default start early error message
HWM_FF_TDR_EARL Y_IN_ERR and the corresponding error type Shift START_EARL Y_ERR_TYPE. If it exists, the
error type is the violation type set for the start early shift limit. Otherwise, it's the message severity set in the
rule.
2. Else if it's between 8:15a and 8:30a, the formula displays the default start late error message
HWM_FF_TDR_LATE_IN_ERR and the corresponding error type Shift START_LATE_ERR_TYPE. If it exists, the
error type is the violation type set for the start early shift limit. Otherwise, it's the message severity set in the
rule.
3. Else if it's before 7:15a or after 8:30a, the formula displays the default error message
HWM_FF_TDR_INVALID_IN_ERR. It also displays the corresponding error type of the message severity set in the
rule.
Check the Out
In this scenario, the scheduled shift ends at 5:00p and has these shift limits:
â¢ Grace period: 15 minutes before and after the end time (4:45p to 5:00p and 5:00p to 5:15p)
â¢ End early: 45 minutes, including the grace period (4:15p to 5:00p)
â¢ End late: 60 minutes, including the grace period (5:00p to 6:00p)
The formula uses the scheduled time and limits to check the reported end time against shift limits in this order:
1. If it's between 4:15p and 4:45p, the formula displays the default end early error message
HWM_FF_TDR_EARL Y_OUT_ERR and the corresponding error type Shift END_EARL Y_ERR_TYPE. If it exists, the
error type is the violation type set for the start early shift limit. Otherwise, it's the message severity set in the
rule.
2. Else if it's between 5:15p and 6:00p, the formula displays the default end late message
HWM_FF_TDR_LATE_OUT_ERR and the corresponding error type Shift END_LATE_ERR_TYPE. If it exists, the
error type is the violation type set for the start early shift limit. Otherwise, it's the message severity set in the
rule.
3. Else if it's before 4:15p or after 6:00p, the formula displays the default error message
HWM_FF_TDR_INVALID_OUT_ERR. It also displays the corresponding error type of the message severity set in
the rule.
Check the Duration
1. If the reported duration is less than the short duration, the formula displays the default message
HWM_FF_TDR_SHORT_DURATION_ERR. It also displays the corresponding error type of the message severity
set in the rule.
2. Else if the reported duration is more than the long duration, the formula displays the default message
HWM_FF_TDR_LONG_DURATION_ERR. It also displays the corresponding error type of the message severity
set in the rule.

ORA_WFM_WCR_APPR_REMIND_ESCALATE_AP Fast
Formula  
This fast formula determines whether the individual, their manager, or both approved the time card. If not, it sends the
specified approval reminder and escalation messages.
Before generating the messages, the formula checks whether the individual is on the manually maintained exclusion
list. If yes, then the process doesn't generate or send reminder and escalation notifications.
Depending on your time approval configuration, individuals might need to approve their time cards to indicate they
consider the time card data to be accurate. And, managers approve submitted time cards as part of the approval
workflows. The formula continues to send reminders if the approval statuses for the time card don't change. This
formula uses an array to process time card data. It isn't associated with any delivered workforce compliance rule
templates.
Parameters
Name Data Type Description
APPROVAL_TYPE Fixed text Specify who gets the reminders. You can
configure worker reminders with different
parameters than the manager reminders
and escalations. The formula has different
escalation and delegation options.
 
The formula doesn't differentiate between
payroll and project managers. It just looks at
who the approver is.
 
Valid values: Worker, Manager, or Both
 
Default and NULL values: Manager
 
The Worker type looks at the worker approval
status. The Manager type looks at the time card
status.
 
ESCL_TO_LEVEL Fixed Number The formula compares the value on the process
with the value set in the rule. If the process
value is less, the formula sends an escalation
reminder. If the process value is more, it doesn't
send an escalation message.
 
Valid values are Arabic numerals.
 
Default and NULL values: 0
 
ENABLE_DELEGATION Yes or No Valid values: Yes or No
Default and NULL values: No

Name Data Type Description
 
REM_UNITS_AFTER_END_DATE Fixed Number Number of units after the end date for the
time card period when the process and rule
run and generate the reminder message. If
today is on or after the end date + this number,
 then the rule can send the reminder message.
Otherwise, it doesn't send the message.
 
The parameter assumes Days if the selected
UOM is D, Hours if it's H, and Minutes if it's M.
 
Valid values are Arabic numerals.
 
Default and NULL values: 7
 
ESCL_UNITS_AFTER_END_DATE Fixed Number Number of units after the end date of the time
card period when the process and rule run and
generate the escalation message. If today is on
or after the end date + this number, the rule can
send the escalation message to the appropriate
manager in the hierarchy. Otherwise, it doesn't
send the message.
 
The parameter assumes Days if the selected
UOM is D, Hours if it's H, and Minutes if it's M.
 
Valid values are Arabic numerals.
 
Default and NULL values: 10
 
ESCALATION_CADENCE Fixed Number Determines how long after the first escalation
to send the escalation notification to the next
management level. For example, If escalation
cadence = 7, the management level increases
every 7 units. The unit comes from the UOM
parameter.
 
Valid values are Arabic numerals.
 
Default and NULL values: 7
 
UOM Fixed Text Used to define what the number of units is after
the end date of the time card period. If D, for
days, then the parameter for start reminder and
escalations is measured in days. If H, then the
parameter is measured in number of hours. If
M, then the parameter is measured in number
of minutes.
 
Valid Values: D (Days), H (Hours), M (Minutes)
 
Default and NULL values: D (Days)

Scenario: The 07 /21/20 to 07 /27 /20 time card was submitted on 07 /26/20 and approval notifications were immediately
sent to the worker and manager. Neither the individual nor their manager approved the time card on 7 /26/20 or the
next day. The manager is a first-level manager, M1. In this example, the Generate Time Exceptions from Compliance
Rules process runs daily.

Workforce Compliance Fast Formula
Results:
1. The first day after the end of the time card period is 07 /28/20. The process sends reminder notifications to
both the individual and the manager because they haven't approved the time card.
2. If the individual and manager still haven't approve the time card when the process runs on 07 /29/20, it sends
them both second reminders. It also sends escalation notifications. A notification goes to the individual's
manager to let the manager know the individual hasn't approved their time card. Another notification goes to
the manager's manager to let them know that the individual's direct manager hasn't approved the time card.
3. If the individual and manager still haven't approved the time card, when the process runs on 07 /30/20, it
sends them both third reminders. It sends second escalation notifications to the manager and the manager's
manager. It also sends escalation notifications to the second-level and third-level managers to let them know
that the first-level manager hasn't approved the time card.
The reminders and escalations continue until the individual and their manager approve the time card. The escalation
level continues until the process notifies the fifth-level manager. At that point, the reminders and escalations continue
to go to the same people.
